/* 0.5
 *    - added WIN_LAYER_MENU
 */
/* 0.4
 *   - added WIN_WORKSPACES for windows appearing on multiple workspaces

 *   - added WinStateDocked
 *   - added WinStateSticky for possible virtual desktops
 *   - changed WIN_ICONS format to be extensible and more complete
 */

/* TODO:
 *   - packed properties for STATE and HINTS (WIN_ALL_STATE and WIN_ALL_HINTS)
 *     currently planned to look like this:
 *      CARD32 nhints
 *        for each hint:
 *         CARD32 atom (hint type)
 *         CARD32 count (data length)
 *         CARD32 data[count]
 *         ...
 *     this has the advantage of being slightly faster, but
 *     demands that all hints are handled at one place. WM ignores
 *     other hints of the same type if these two are present.
 
 *   - check out WMaker and KDE hints to make a superset of all
 *   - virtual desktop, handling of virtual (>screen) scrolling
 *     desktops and pages (fvwm like?)
 *   - vroot.h?
 *   - MOZILLA_ZORDER (it should be possible to do the same thing
 *      with WIN_* hints)
 *   - there should be a way to coordinate corner/edge points of the frames
 *     (for placement). ICCCM is vague on this issue. icewm prefers to treat
 *     windows as client-area and titlebar when doing the placement (ignoring
 *     the frame)
 *   - hint limit wm key/mouse bindings on a window
 * possible
 *   - what does MOTIF_WM_INFO do?
 *   - WIN_MAXIMIZED_GEOMETRY
 *   - WIN_RESIZE (protocol that allows applications to start sizing the frame)
 *   - WIN_FOCUS (protocol for focusing a window)
