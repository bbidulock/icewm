# Configuration file for xrandr command execution used by icewm's "Win-P" menu background script.
#
# Save this as ~/.config/icewm/xrandr_menu or ~/.icewm/xrandr_menu
# and adjust the monitor specific options.
#
# Config is processed sequentially before or after apply xrandr commands.
# Multiple sections refering to the same output or combo are allowed, the
# options and commands will be merged and/or replaced by later matches.
# Identical "postcmd" strings will be deduplicated.
#
# The sections ("output" for options of an individual signal output, "combo"
# for the context of the whole composition) can be enabled (selected) by
# selectors, either as a name of this section (see below) or selection hint in
# the section.
#
# For detailed options passed to xrandr, see its manpage.

# Common setting. When the primary screen changes, force a quick restart of
# icewm. This might be required because the positioning of the Icewm taskbar or
# features of certain windows gets confused.

[output]
# Select this section for devices whose output matches this name.
# If surrounded by slashes, the name is evaluated as a regular expression.
match-name = /DP-3/

# Alternatively, match by label of this device.
#        match-label = LG.*2730
# Custom label can be assigned. However, this influences further filtering!
# Optionally, some patterns can be automatically substituted:
# - output interface name via %OUTPUT
# - original auto-determined label via %LABEL
# - an asterix mark on the output which becomes the new primary via %PRIMFLAG
label=BigScreen(%LABEL)@%OUTPUT%PRIMFLAG

# 
# List of any xrandr options added as prefix of this output configuration
# Typically, one might use this to set the mode and refresh rate
# For possible values, see "xrandr" output.
# NOTE: using --auto or omiting resolution while specifying refresh rate might
# turn the refresh rate hint ineffective. So specify both!
# This option does not replace position parameters, see below for posopt if
# this is wanted.
#
# Default: --auto
#
# options = --mode 1920x1080 -r 120
# 
# Postcmd is passed directly into a shell command, be warned about all
# implications, see "-c" option description of your /bin/sh executable.
#        postcmd = xrandr --output %OUTPUT --set "Broadcast RGB" "Full"

# Naming a section is equivalent to specifying match-name=...
#[output "eDP1"]
#options = -r 48
#
# Replace auto-generated options for left/right positioning choice. Use THIS
# options instead to manually position the viewport where we want it. Further
# xrandr options like --rotate ... can be added here.
#
# Example: always position an 1080p monitor (matched here) on the right of a 1440p screen but aligned at the bottom, thus shifting down by 360 lines.
#posopt = --pos 2560x360
