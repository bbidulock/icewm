Settings that override the settings from a theme.  Some of the B<icewm>
configuration options from the preferences file that control the
look-and-feel may be overridden by the theme, if the theme designer
thinks this is desirable.  However, this F<prefoverride> file will again
override this for a few specific options of your choosing.  It is safe
to leave this file empty initially.
