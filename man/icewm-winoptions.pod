=head2 NAME

 icewm-winoptions - IceWM window options configuration file

=head2 SYNOPSIS

 $ICEWM_PRIVCFG/winoptions
 $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/icewm/winoptions
 $HOME/.icewm/winoptions
 /etc/icewm/winoptions
 /usr/share/icewm/winoptions

=head2 DESCRIPTION

The IceWM F<winoptions> file contains settings to control
I<application specific> window appearance and behavior.
For instance, they control the window border, placement and size,
the window layer, its workspace, its visibility on the task bar
and its focus behavior.

The winoptions are established when L<icewm(1)> starts.  However,
they can be overridden later using L<icesh(1)> or L<icewmhint(1)>.
The command C<icesh winoptions> instructs icewm to reload the
F<winoptions> file, while F<icewmhint> tunes a specific application
instance when it starts.

=head2 FORMAT

Each line in the file must be in one of the following formats:

=over

=over

=item I<NAME>B<.>I<CLASS>B<.>I<OPTION>B<:> I<VALUE>

=item I<CLASS>B<.>I<ROLE>B<.>I<OPTION>B<:> I<VALUE>

=item I<NAME>B<.>I<ROLE>B<.>I<OPTION>B<:> I<VALUE>

=item I<CLASS>B<.>I<OPTION>B<:> I<VALUE>

=item I<NAME>B<.>I<OPTION>B<:> I<VALUE>

=item I<ROLE>B<.>I<OPTION>B<:> I<VALUE>

=item B<.>I<OPTION>B<:> I<VALUE>

=back

=back

Here I<NAME> and I<CLASS> are from the B<WM_CLASS> property of the
window. This can be found in the output of C<icesh -a getClass>.

While I<ROLE> refers to the B<WM_WINDOW_ROLE> property of the window,
which is the application instance specific name. Only a minority of
windows have it. See the output of C<icesh -a list prop WM_WINDOW_ROLE>.

In rare cases, a name, class or role may contain a period. If it does,
the period should be escaped by a single backslash.

Lastly, the I<OPTION: VALUE> pair refer to the options and values
described below. A line with just a dot, followed by an option/value
pair, applies to all windows.

=head2 OPTIONS

There are four categories: I<general>, I<function>, I<decor> and
I<feature>.

=head2 GENERAL OPTIONS

These control general characteristics of windows:

=over

=item B<icon>: I<NAME> (default: none)

Specifies the icon name for the window.  I<NAME> is the icon name, like
F<utilities-terminal>. It can also be a file, like F<xterm.png>, a full
path, or a prefix of a path without sizes or suffix.

=item B<workspace>: I<WORKSPACE> (default: current)

Specifies the default workspace for the window.  I<WORKSPACE> is the
workspace number counting from zero (0).

=item B<layer>: {I<LAYER>|I<NUMBER>} (default: Normal)

Specifies the default layer for the window.  Layer can be one of the
following names or a number from zero to fifteen:

  Desktop     (0)  Desktop window.
  Below       (2)  Below the default layer.
  Normal      (4)  Default layer for windows.
  OnTop       (6)  Above the default layer.
  Dock        (8)  Docked windows at edge of screen.
  AboveDock  (10)  Windows above the dock.
  Menu       (12)  The layer for menu's.
  Fullscreen (14)  When fullscreen and focused.
  AboveAll   (15)  Always above anything.

=item B<geometry> I<geometry> (default: WM_SIZE_HINTS property)

The default geometry for the window.  This geometry should be specified
in a format that can be parsed by L<XParseGeometry(3)>:

 [=][<width>{xX}<height>][{+-}<xoffset>{+-}<yoffset>]

The default geometry is taken from the WM_SIZE_HINTS property of the
window or else from the initial window geometry. This option overrides
the default.

=item B<tray>: {B<Ignore>|B<Minimized>|B<Exclusive>|I<NUMBER>} (default: 0)

The default tray option for the window.  This affects both the tray and
the task pane.  Tray can be one of the following three strings or a number
from zero (0) to two (2):

  Ignore     (0)  No icon is added to the tray.
  Minimized  (1)  Add to tray, no task when minimized.
  Exclusive  (2)  Add to tray, no task button.

=item B<order>: I<NUMBER> (default: 0)

The sorting order for task buttons, tray icons, quick switch and window
list. The default value is zero. Increasing positive values go right,
while decreasing negative values go left.

=item B<opacity>: I<NUMBER> (default: 0)

Set the _NET_WM_WINDOW_OPACITY property if I<NUMBER> is a value between
1 and 100. I<NUMBER> is interpreted as percentage of maximum opaqueness.

=item B<keyboard>: I<layout> (default: none)

Specifies the keyboard layout to use for this window. 
The I<layout> is the name of a keyboard layout.
It can be a space-separated list of arguments to the
B<setxkbmap> program. Please note that B<setxkbmap>
must be installed for this to work. Also define
a default keyboard layout in F<preferences>.

=item B<frame>: I<label> (default: none)

All windows with the same frame label become tabs in a single frame.

=back

=head2 FUNCTION OPTIONS

Function options enable/disable (1/0) the ability to take an action on
the window.  The normal default for all options is enabled (1) unless
overridden by the application:

  fClose:    {0|1}  can be closed.        (default: 1)
  fHide:     {0|1}  can be hidden.        (default: 1)

  fMove:     {0|1}  can be moved.         (default: 1)
  fResize:   {0|1}  can be resized.       (default: 1)
  fRollup:   {0|1}  can be shaded.        (default: 1)

=head2 DECOR OPTIONS

Decor options enable/disable (1/0) decorations on the window.  The
normal default for all options is enabled (1) unless overridden by the
application or the theme:

  dBorder:   {0|1}  has border.           (default: 1)

  dSysMenu:  {0|1}  has window menu.      (default: 1)
  dTitleBar: {0|1}  has title bar.        (default: 1)

=head2 FEATURE OPTIONS

The normal default for all options is disabled (0) unless overridden by
the application:

  allWorkspaces:            {1|0}  on all workspaces.
  appTakesFocus:            {1|0}  let application take focus.

=head2 EXAMPLES

This example uses the WM_WINDOW_ROLE property value C<pop-up> to deny
input focus to I<Chrome> pop-ups and asks to close them immediately.

  google-chrome.pop-up.doNotFocus: 1
  google-chrome.pop-up.forcedClose: 1
  google-chrome.pop-up.ignorePagerPreview: 1
  google-chrome.pop-up.ignoreUrgentHint: 1
  google-chrome.pop-up.layer: Below
  google-chrome.pop-up.noFocusOnAppRaise: 1
  google-chrome.pop-up.noFocusOnMap: 1
  google-chrome.pop-up.startClose: 1
  google-chrome.pop-up.startMinimized: 1

IceWM places dockapps in a container automatically, but for those
which fail to comply with the protocol it can also be emulated.
An emulated dockapp should appear on all workspaces, have
no decorations, and always be visible in a fixed location.

  wmtime.wmtime.allWorkspaces: 1
  wmtime.wmtime.ignoreTaskBar: 1
  wmtime.wmtime.ignoreQuickSwitch: 1
  wmtime.wmtime.ignoreWinList: 1
  wmtime.wmtime.layer: Below
  wmtime.wmtime.dTitleBar: 0
  wmtime.wmtime.dBorder: 1
  wmtime.wmtime.geometry: 64x64-74-100

Following shows how a shaped output-only application is shown
without titlebar and minimal functionality.

  xeyes.tray: Exclusive
  xeyes.ignoreWinList: 0
  xeyes.ignoreTaskBar: 1
  xeyes.allWorkspaces: 1
  xeyes.dTitleBar: 0
  xeyes.dBorder: 0
  xeyes.dSysMenu: 0
  xeyes.dResize: 0
  xeyes.dClose: 0
  xeyes.dMinimize: 0
  xeyes.dMaximize: 0
