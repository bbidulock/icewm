=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<icesh> provides commands for use by shell scripts that affect a
window's state similar to L<wmctl(1)> or L<xdotool(1)>, except more
limited, specifically for B<icewm(1)>, and limited to affecting GNOME
WinWM/WMH properties.

=head1 OPTIONS

B<icesh> recognizes the following options:

=head2 COMMAND OPTIONS

Command options are mutually exclusive.  Only one command option can be
specified per invocation.  If no command option is specified, action
argument parsing and processing is performed.

=over

=item B<-h>, B<--help>

Print a brief usage statement to F<stdout> and exit.

=item B<-V>, B<--version>

Print the program version to F<stdout> and exit.

=item B<-C>, B<--copying>

Print copying permissions to F<stdout> for the program and exit.

=back

=head2 GENERAL OPTIONS

=over

=item B<-display> I<DISPLAY>

Specifies the X11 I<DISPLAY> to use.  When unspecified, defaults to the
$DISPLAY environment variable.

=item B<-window> I<WINDOW_ID>

Specifies the identifier of the window, I<WINDOW_ID>, for which the
action applies.
When no I<WINDOW_ID> or I<WM_CLASS> is specified, a selection crossbar
is invoked to select the desired window.

=item B<-class> I<WM_CLASS>

Specifies the window manager class, I<WM_CLASS>, for which the action
applies.
When no I<WINDOW_ID> or I<WM_CLASS> is specified, a selection crossbar
is invoked to select the desired window.

=head1 ARGUMENTS

B<icesh> accepts the following arguments:

L</GNOME window hints>, below, for I<HINTS> symbols.

=item B<setLayer> I<LAYER>

Moves the specified window to another I<GNOME window layer>.  See
L</GNOME window layer>, below, for I<LAYER> symbols.

=item B<setWorkspace> I<WORKSPACE>

Moves the specified window to another workspace.  Select the root
window to change the current workspace.

=item B<listWorkspaces>

Lists the names of all workspaces.

=item B<setTrayOption> I<TRAYOPTION>

Set the I<IceWM tray option> hint for the specified window to
I<TRAYOPTION>.  See L</IceWM tray options>, below, for I<TRAYOPTION>
symbols.

=back

=item B<EXPRESSION> ::= I<SYMBOL> | I<EXPRESSION> { C<+> | C<|> }
I<SYMBOL>

Each I<SYMBOL> may be from one of the following applicable domains:

=over

=item I<GNOME window state>

Named symbols of the domain I<GNOME window state> (numeric range:
0-1023):

    AllWorkspaces          (1)
    Sticky                 (1)
    Minimized              (2)

    Hidden                (16)
    All                 (1023)

These symbols are used with the I<MASK> and I<STATE> arguments to the
C<setState> and C<toggleState> actions.

=item I<GNOME window hint>

Named symbols of the domain I<GNOME window hint> (numeric range: 0-63):

    SkipFocus              (1)

action.

=item I<GNOME window layer>

Named symbols of the domain I<GNOME window layer> (numeric range: 0-15):

    Desktop                (0)

action.

=item I<IceWM tray option>

Named symbols of the domain I<IceWM tray option> (numeric range: 0-2):

    Ignore                 (0)
    Minimized              (1)

=head1 USAGE

The purpose of B<icesh> is to provide commands that can be used from a
shell script (see L<sh(1)>) to affect the state, geometry and hints
associated with a window, or to list and parse information about
existing windows.

It should be noted that B<icesh> works on any window manager that is
compliant with the GNOME WinWM/WMH specification.  The C<setTrayOption>
action; however, is IceWM specific.

=head1 EXAMPLES

The following command will list all the workspaces associated with the
root window after a window (any window) is selected:

    icesh listWorkspaces

Example output:

    workspace #0: `main'
    workspace #1: `web'
    workspace #2: `doc'
    workspace #3: `dev'
    workspace #4: `scr'
    workspace #5: `gfx'
    workspace #6: `misc'
    workspace #7: `'

=head1 ENVIRONMENT

The following environment variables are set or examined by B<icesh>:

=over

=item B<DISPLAY>

When the B<-display> option is not specified, the C<DISPLAY> environment
variable is consulted to determine the display.

=back

=head1 COMPLIANCE

While B<icesh> is largely compliant with the GNOME WinWM/WMH
specification, it does not support NetWM/EWMH.

=head1 BUGS

B<icesh> had no known bugs at the time of release.  Please report bugs
for current versions to the source code repository at
L<https://github.com/bbidulock/icewm/issues>.

=head1 HISTORY

B<icesh> is historical and deprecated.  The command originally (and
still) only supported the GNOME WinWM/WMH specification.  Unlike
L<wmctl(1)> and L<xdotool(1)>, NetWM/EWMH support was never included.
Except for the C<setTrayOption> command, L<wmctl(1)> and L<xdotool(1)>
are quite capable of performing the necessary functions and more.
