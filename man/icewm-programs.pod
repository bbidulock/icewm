 icewm-programs - icewm programs configuration file

=head1 SYNOPSIS

F<> F<$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/icewm/programs>
 F<$HOME/.icewm/programs>
 F</usr/share/icewm/programs>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The F<menu> file is responsible for configuring most of the generated
items in the L<icewm(1)> root menu and start menu, and is normally
included in those menus using the B<menufile> keyword.

=head1 FORMAT

The format of the file contains one of the following line syntax:

=over

=item B<prog> [B<">]I<title>[B<">] I<icon> I<program> I<options>

Specifies a program to execute when the menu item is selected.

=item B<restart> [B<">]I<title>[B<">] I<icon> I<program> I<options>

Specifies a program to replace the window manager when the menu item is
selected.  This is for launching other window managers from within
L<icewm(1)>.

=item B<runonce> [B<">]I<title>[B<">] I<icon> B<">[I<res_name>][B<.>I<res_class>]B<"> I<program> I<options>

Specifies a program to execute when the menu item is selected; however,
if a window of the specified I<res_name> and I<res_class> is present,
the program will not be run again.

=item B<menu> [B<">]I<title>[B<">] I<icon> B<{>
 # contained items
 B<}>

Specifies a sub-menu.  The lines that appear between the braces can be
any menu item described here.

=item B<menufile> [B<">]I<title>[B<">] I<icon> I<filename>, B<separator>

Specifies a file from which to collect sub-menu items (lines) and place
them at this point in the menu.

=item B<menuprog> [B<">]I<title>[B<">] I<icon> I<program> I<options>

Specifies a program that will print sub-menu items on standard output
and will be collected and placed in the sub-menu at this point.

=item B<separator>

A separator for menu items.

=back

where,

=over

=item B<prog>, B<restart>, B<runonce>, B<menu>, B<menufile>,
B<menuprog>, B<separator>

These are literal string keywords.

=item [B<">]I<title>[B<">]

This is the I<title> string associated with the menu item which is
displayed in the menu.  When the I<title> contains spaces, the title
must be surrounded by double quotes (C<">), although the I<title> may
always be surrounded by double quotes if preferred.

=item I<icon>

Is the name of the icon file (with or without extension) or the full
path to an icon file.

=item B<">[I<res_name>][B<.>I<res_class>]B<">

I<res_name> is the resource name of a window launched by I<program> and
I<res_class> is the resource class of the window.  Only one of
I<res_name> or I<res_class> need be specified.  This is used to identify
whether the program is already running and is for use with the
B<runonce> keyword.

=item I<program> I<options>

I<program> is the name of the executable or full path to the executable file that will
be run in response to selecting the menu item.  When used with the
B<menuprog> keyword, the I<program> must print on standard output the
contents of the menu and is used for dynamic menus.

I<options> is the options and arguments passed to the I<program>
verbatim.

=item I<filename>

I<filename> is the name of the file relative to one of the L<icewm(1)>
configuration directories, or the full path to a file.  The file is used
with the B<menufile> keyword and specifies the file from which to read
further menu items.
