=head1 NAME

 icesound - play audio files when interesting GUI events happen

=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<icesound> [I<OPTIONS>]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The L<icewm(1)> window manager can be configured to generate so-called
GUI events in response to interesting actions, like opening or closing
of application windows, switching of work space, etc.  GUI events are a
property of the root window.  L<icewm(1)> changes this property when a
new GUI event occurs.  Interested applications can listen for changes to
this property.  GUI events are an optional feature of L<icewm(1)>.  It
must be explicitly enabled by giving the B<--enable-guievents> option
during configuration.  There are nearly twenty GUI events defined.  The
B<--list-sounds> option will show them.

B<icesound> is an application, which is one of the L<icewm(1)>
applications, which responds to these GUI events by playing audio files.
These sound files are F<.wav> files located in a F<sounds> sub-directory
in one of the L<icewm(1)> configuration directories.

B<icesound> supports several common audio interfaces.  These are: ALSA,
ESounD, OSS and libAO.  These must be enabled during configuration.
ALSA, OSS and libAO all require support for L<libsndfile>, which is a
very common library to read audio files.

=over

=item B<ALSA>

B<ALSA> is rather involved to program and it works, but this could use
more testing.  It plays at most one sound at a time.

=item B<ESounD>

The B<ESounD> interface is much simpler to implement and this works very
well, because the difficult details are handled by the B<ESounD> Sound
Daemon.  It supports mixing of sounds when multiple GUI events occur
within a second.  This may be the best option currently.  It requires
that L<esd(1)> is running and that B<icesound> can connect to it.

=item B<LibAO>

B<LibAO> is a cross-platform audio output library which is a convenient
wrapper around a significant number of common audio interfaces.  It has
a simple configuration file which is documented in the L<libao.conf(5)>
manual page.

=item B<OSS>

The I<Open Sound System (OSS)> is a cross-platform sound interface,
which is fully supported by B<icesound>.

=back

When multiple audio interfaces are available B<icesound> will examine
them all until it finds one which it can connect to and then use that
one.  By default it prefers them in the order of: B<AO>, B<ESD>,
B<ALSA>, B<OSS>.

B<ALSA>, B<OSS> separated by commas (C<,>).

=item B<-D>, B<--device>=I<DEVICE>

Backwards compatibility only: the default device.
Please prefer one of the B<-A>, B<-O> or B<-S> options.
