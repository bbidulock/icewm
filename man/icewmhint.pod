=head1 NAME

 icewmhint - set IceWM hints by window class and instance

=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<icewmhint> [I<CLASS>B<.>I<INSTANCE>] I<OPTION> I<VALUE>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<icewmhint> is a simple utility for passing IceWM hints to L<icewm(1)>
by window class and instance.  Unlike tools that use WMH or EWMH, such
as L<icesh(1)>, L<wmctl(1)> and L<xdotool(1)>, B<icewmhint> uses a
special property, C<_ICEWM_WINOPHINT>, on the root window to pass
special hints to L<icewm(1)>.

=head1 OPTIONS

B<icesh> recognizes the following options:

=head2 COMMAND OPTIONS

Command options are mutually exclusive.  Only one command option can be
specified per invocation.  If no command option is specified, argument
parsing and processing is performed.

=over

=item B<-h>, B<--help>

Print a brief usage statement to F<stdout> and exit.

=item B<-V>, B<--version>

Print the program version to F<stdout> and exit.

=item B<-C>, B<--copying>

Print copying permissions to F<stdout> for the program and exit.

=back

=head2 GENERAL OPTIONS

B<icewmhint> has not general options: all information is passed using
non-option arguments.

=head1 ARGUMENTS

The following arguments are required:

=over

=item [I<CLASS>B<.>I<INSTANCE>]

Specifies the ICCCM 2.0 B<WM_CLASS> property in terms of resource name
and resource class separated by a period (C<.>).  For example:
C<XTerm.xterm>.  This argument must be specified for all commands
affecting client windows.

=item I<OPTION> I<VALUE>

Specifies the I<OPTION> to affect and the I<VALUE> that goes with the
option.  Options and their arguments are as follows:

=back

=head2 GENERAL OPTION ARGUMENTS

General option arguments are normally associated with GNOME WinWM/WMH
hints (except for the tray option argument).

=over

=item B<icon> I<NAME>

Specifies the icon name for windows of I<CLASS>B<.>I<INSTANCE>.
I<NAME> should be the name of the icon.  L<icewm(1)> will use is
usual method to find the icon.  The default is the name provided by
window manager hints.

=item B<workspace> I<WORKSPACE>

Specifies the workspace on which a window of I<CLASS>B<.>I<INSTANCE>
will be initially placed.  The default is to place the window on the
current workspace.  I<WORKSPACE> should be a numeric workspace
number (counting from 0).

=item B<geometry> I<GEOMETRY>

Specifies the initial geometry for windows of the given
I<CLASS>B<.>I<INSTANCE>.  I<GEOMETRY> must be a geometry that can be
parsed by L<XParseGeometry(3)>.  The default is the geometry provided by
window manager hints.

=item B<layer> {B<Desktop>|B<Below>|B<Normal>|B<OnTop>|B<Dock>|B<AboveDock>|B<Menu>|I<NUMBER>}

The layer is a similar concept to the layer specified by GNOME/WMH and
implied by NetWM/EWMH.  It is in this case however specific to
L<icewm(1)>.

The command option specifies the layer to be associated with an
I<CLASS>B<.>I<INSTANCE>.  The default is the C<Normal> layer.  I<VALUE>
is either a numeric layer I<NUMBER> or a symbolic layer name.  Symbolic
layer names are one of the following:

B<>    B<Desktop>    (0)  desktop window layer.
    B<Below>      (2)  below normal windows.
    B<Normal>     (4)  default window layer.
    B<OnTop>      (6)  above normal windows.
    B<Dock>       (8)  docks (panels and edge displays).
    B<AboveDock> (10)  above docks.
    B<Menu>      (12)  above everything else.

=item B<tray> {B<Ignore>|B<Minimized>|B<Exclusive>|I<NUMBER>}

Specifies the tray handling to be applied to windows with
I<CLASS>B<.>I<INSTANCE>.  This option is specific to L<icewm(1)> and
sets the C<_ICEWM_TRAY> property associated with the window.
The default is C<Ignore>.  I<VALUE> can be a numerical option I<NUMBER>
or a symbolic name as follows:

B<>    B<Ignore>     (0)  only in task list.
    B<Minimized>  (1)  icon in tray, task list unminimized.
    B<Exclusive>  (2)  only in tray, not in task list.

=head2 FUNCTION OPTION ARGUMENTS

Specifies which functions are disabled/enabled (0/1) for windows with
I<CLASS>B<.>I<INSTANCE>.  All function options have a default value of
enabled (1) unless overridden by the application.  The Motif-like
functions are as follows:

B<>    B<fMove>      can be moved.         (default: 1)
    B<fResize>    can be resized.       (default: 1)
    B<fClose>     can be closed.        (default: 1)
    B<fMinimize>  can be minimized.     (default: 1)
    B<fMaximize>  can be maximized.     (default: 1)
    B<fHide>      can be hidden.        (default: 1)

    B<dHide>      has hide button.      (default: 1)
    B<dRollup>    has shade button.     (default: 1)
    B<dDepth>     has depth button.     (default: 1)

=head2 FEATURE OPTION ARGUMENTS
