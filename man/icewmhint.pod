=head1 NAME

 icewmhint - set IceWM hints by window class and instance

=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<icewmhint> [I<CLASS>B<.>I<INSTANCE>] I<OPTION> I<VALUE>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<icewmhint> is a simple utility for passing IceWM hints to L<icewm(1)>
by window class and instance.  Unlike tools that use WMH or EWMH, such
as L<icesh(1)>, L<wmctrl(1)> and L<xdotool(1)>, B<icewmhint> uses a
special property, C<_ICEWM_WINOPHINT>, on the root window to pass
special hints to L<icewm(1)>.

=head1 OPTIONS

B<icesh> recognizes the following options:

=head2 COMMAND OPTIONS

Command options are mutually exclusive.  Only one command option can be
specified per invocation.  If no command option is specified, argument
parsing and processing is performed.

=over

=item B<-h>, B<--help>

Print a brief usage statement to F<stdout> and exit.

=item B<-V>, B<--version>

Print the program version to F<stdout> and exit.

=item B<-C>, B<--copying>

Print copying permissions to F<stdout> for the program and exit.

=head2 GENERAL OPTIONS

B<icewmhint> has not general options: all information is passed using
non-option arguments.

=head1 ARGUMENTS

The following arguments are required:

=over

=item [I<CLASS>B<.>I<INSTANCE>]

Specifies the ICCCM 2.0 B<WM_CLASS> property in terms of resource name
and resource class separated by a period (C<.>).  For example:
C<XTerm.xterm>.  This argument must be specified for all commands
affecting client windows.

=item I<OPTION> I<VALUE>

Specifies the I<OPTION> to affect and the I<VALUE> that goes with the
option.  Options and their arguments are as follows:

=back

=head2 GENERAL OPTION ARGUMENTS

General option arguments are normally associated with GNOME WinWM/WMH
hints (except for the tray option argument).

=over

=item B<icon> I<NAME>

Specifies the icon name for windows of I<CLASS>B<.>I<INSTANCE>.
I<NAME> should be the name of the icon.  L<icewm(1)> will use is
usual method to find the icon.  The default is the name provided by
window manager hints.

=item B<workspace> I<WORKSPACE>

Specifies the workspace on which a window of I<CLASS>B<.>I<INSTANCE>
will be initially placed.  The default is to place the window on the
current workspace.  I<WORKSPACE> should be a numeric workspace
number (counting from 0).

=item B<geometry> I<GEOMETRY>

Specifies the initial geometry for windows of the given
I<CLASS>B<.>I<INSTANCE>.  I<GEOMETRY> must be a geometry that can be
parsed by L<XParseGeometry(3)>.  The default is the geometry provided by
window manager hints.

=item B<layer> {B<Desktop>|B<Below>|B<Normal>|B<OnTop>|B<Dock>|B<AboveDock>|B<Menu>|I<NUMBER>}

The layer is a similar concept to the layer specified by GNOME/WMH and
implied by NetWM/EWMH.  It is in this case however specific to
L<icewm(1)>.

The command option specifies the layer to be associated with an
I<CLASS>B<.>I<INSTANCE>.  The default is the C<Normal> layer.  I<VALUE>
is either a numeric layer I<NUMBER> or a symbolic layer name.  Symbolic
layer names are one of the following:

    Desktop    (0)  desktop window layer.
    Below      (2)  below normal windows.
    Normal     (4)  default window layer.
    OnTop      (6)  above normal windows.
    Dock       (8)  docks (panels and edge displays).
    AboveDock (10)  above docks.
    Menu      (12)  above everything else.

=item B<tray> {B<Ignore>|B<Minimized>|B<Exclusive>|I<NUMBER>}

Specifies the tray handling to be applied to windows with
I<CLASS>B<.>I<INSTANCE>.  This option is specific to L<icewm(1)> and
sets the C<_ICEWM_TRAY> property associated with the window.
The default is C<Ignore>.  I<VALUE> can be a numerical option I<NUMBER>
or a symbolic name as follows:

    Ignore     (0)  only in task list.
    Minimized  (1)  icon in tray, task list unminimized.
    Exclusive  (2)  only in tray, not in task list.

=head2 FUNCTION OPTION ARGUMENTS

Specifies which functions are disabled/enabled (0/1) for windows with
I<CLASS>B<.>I<INSTANCE>.  All function options have a default value of
