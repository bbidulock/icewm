1. Requirements

    - libXpm
    - C++ compiler (tested: gcc 2.8.1, gcc 2.95.3, gcc 3.0)
    - GNU make (very minor tweaks required for other make variants)

  Optional:

    - Imlib (for wider image support)
    - gnome-libs (for gnome menu support)
    - sgml2html (part of sgml-tools package) to rebuild HTML documentation
    - XFreeType (for antialising)

2. Compiling

    - cd icewm-$version
    - Run './autogen.sh' when fetched from CVS.
    - Run './configure --help' to see available options.
    - Run './configure' possibly with options
    - If needed: customize sysdep.inc for your platform.
    - If needed: customize install.inc with correct installation directories.

    Please send me any changes that you may need to make.
  
    - Type 'make' to build it.

3. Installing

    Default installation path is /usr/local, if you change it by using
    configure switches like --prefix or --sysconfdir. You have to rebuild
    everything (make clean ; make) after changing the paths.

    - Type 'make install' as root user to install. (make -n install to
    verify things first if you are not sure).

3.a Configuring XFreeType

    XFreeType supports most font formats supported by XFree86's traditional
    font services including TrueType, Type1 and bitmap fonts. To achieve
    best results you should all your font directories to /etc/XftConfig
    or ~/.xftconfig by using the "dir" statement. You should also ensure
    that Xft can supply a font comparable with Adobe's Helvetica since 
    icewm uses it as default font and a lot of themes written for icewm
    depend on it. If you don't have such a font sufficent for Xft you
    could add an alias definition pointing on "Nimbus Sans L" to your 
    XFreeType configuration file:
    
	match any family == "helvetica" edit family += "Nimbus Sans L";

    Another nice feature of XFreeType you should enable is sub-pixel 
    decimation since it improves rendering quality alot. Simply add 
    the following line to your X resources (~/.Xdefaults):

        Xft.rgba: rgb

4. Starting icewm
    
    Make sure the icewm executables are located on $PATH, otherwise
    it will not be possible to restart the window manager.

    Normally, icewm should be started from ~/.Xclients file. This will
    work the same for 'startx' and 'xdm' logins. The file must have execute
    permissions (chmod a+x ~/.Xclients).
    
    An example of ~/.Xclients file would be:

    >>> cut here >>> ----- > ----- > ----- > ----- > ----- > ----- > ----- >

	# set mouse speed
	xset m 5 2

	# start xterm by default
	xterm &

	# silently check if icewm is in your $PATH and start icewm when found
	# or a red colored xterm when not found or execution of icewm fails
	which icewm >/dev/null 2>&1 && exec icewm || exec xterm -bg red

    <<< cut here <<< ----- < ----- < ----- < ----- < ----- < ----- < ----- <

    Another good candidate for launching X clients is ~/.xinitrc 
    if the maintainers of your OS have odd ideas about how to initialize X.
    As last resort you could ask your OS to run a shell script containing
    all the apps you want to fireup instead of running icewm's binary directly:
    Simply insert a line saying "#!/bin/sh" in front of the script listed
    above and set the executable flags of your new script.
