NAME
----
icewmbg - a background settings manager for the IceWM window manager


SYNOPSIS
--------
*icewmbg* ['OPTIONS']


DESCRIPTION
-----------
Icewmbg can assign a color or image to the X11 desktop background.
Many image formats are supported.
Each IceWM workspace can have its own background.

When the background image has changed then
icewmbg can be notified to update the background.
When switching workspaces it checks the image file modification time.
If the file has changed then it reloads the background image from file.

Icewmbg supports semitransparency.
Semitransparent background image(s) and color(s) can be configured.
If these are not specified then the default background is used.

It uses Xinerama and Xrandr to support backgrounds on all connected monitors.
When monitors appear/disappear or change their resolution icewmbg will adjust.
It supports an option for one large background over all monitors.

It should be started before icewm, preferably by the icewm-session program.

OPTIONS
-------
Where multiple values can be given for images or colors
they are separated by commas.
When 'FILE' is a directory then all images
from that directory are used in sorted order.

*-p, --replace*::
  Replace an existing icewmbg. If there is a running icewmbg
  it is instructed to quit. The new icewmbg will take over.

*-q, --quit*::
  Tell the running icewmbg to quit. This option is used by
  'icewm-session' when IceWM exits.

*-r, --restart*::
  Tell the running icewmbg to restart itself.
  This is useful when a background file or directory
  has changed or when settings in preferences files have changed.

*-c, --config=FILE*::
  Load preferences from 'FILE'.

*-t, --theme=NAME*::
  Load the theme with name 'NAME'.

*-i, --image=FILE(S)*::
  Load background image(s) from 'FILE(S)'.
  This overrules the 'DesktopBackgroundImage' preference.

*-k, --color=NAME(S)*::
  Use background color(s) from 'NAME(S)'.
  This overrules the 'DesktopBackgroundColor' preference.

*-s, --semis=FILE(S)*::
  Load transparency image(s) from 'FILE(S)'.
  This overrules the 'DesktopTransparencyImage' preference.

*-x, --trans=NAME(S)*::
  Use transparency color(s) from 'NAME(S)'.
  This overrules the 'DesktopTransparencyColor' preference.

*-e, --center=0/1*::
  Disable/Enable centering background.
  This overrules the 'DesktopBackgroundCenter' preference.

*-a, --scaled=0/1*::
  Disable/Enable scaling background.
  This overrules the 'DesktopBackgroundScaled' preference.

*-m, --multi=0/1*::
  Disable/Enable multihead background.
  This overrules the 'DesktopBackgroundMultihead' preference.

*--display=NAME*::
  Use 'NAME' to connect to the X server.
  If this option is missing then 'NAME'
  is read from the environment variable DISPLAY.

*--sync*::
  Use a slower synchronous mode communication with X11 server.

*-h, --help*::
  Print the icewmbg usage screen and exit.

*-V, --version*::
  Print version information and exit.


PREFERENCES
-----------
By default icewmbg will load the background settings
from the IceWM preferences files.
The settings read are:

  DesktopBackgroundCenter    - Display desktop background centered
  DesktopBackgroundScaled    - Display desktop background scaled
  DesktopBackgroundColor     - Desktop background color(s)
  DesktopBackgroundImage     - Desktop background image(s)
  SupportSemitransparency    - Support for semitransparent terminals
  DesktopTransparencyColor   - Semitransparency background color(s)
  DesktopTransparencyImage   - Semitransparency background image(s)
  DesktopBackgroundMultihead - One background over all monitors

First these settings are read from the 'preferences' file.
Then the theme file from the current theme is read,
which may overrule the 'preferences' settings.
Lastly the 'prefoverride' file is read, which overrides again.
Therefore, if you want to allow the theme to set the background
use 'preferences' for your settings, otherwise use 'prefoverride'.


SCALING
-------
Often a background image has a different width or height than the screen.
The settings can specify to center ('DesktopBackgroundCenter')
or scale ('DesktopBackgroundScaled') an image.
Either option is either 0 (disabled) or 1 (enabled).
What happens for their combination is given by the following table:

  center:0 scaled:0 = the background is replicated in both directions
  center:1 scaled:0 = the background is centered, but not scaled
  center:1 scaled:1 = fill one dimension and keep aspect the ratio
  center:0 scaled:1 = fill both dimensions and keep aspect the ratio
