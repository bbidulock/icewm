<P>
<P>The goal of <B>IceWM</B> is to provide a small, fast and familiar window
manager for the X11 window system. Compatibility with the
<CODE>mwm</CODE> window manager is desired and will be implemented where
appropriate.
<P><B>IceWM</B> originally was designed to emulate the look of Motif, OS/2 Warp
4, OS/2 Warp 3 and Windows 95. Since it has a theming engine (hint:
<A HREF="http://www.icewm.org/">http://www.icewm.org/</A>) others styles are possible.
<P>It also tries to combine the feel of the above systems whenever it
is compatible.
<P>Generally, it tries to make all functions available both by keyboard
and by mouse (this is not currently possible when using mouse focus).
<P>Extreme configurability similar to <CODE>fvwm</CODE> and many other window
managers is <B>NOT</B> the goal.
<P>Further information can be found at
