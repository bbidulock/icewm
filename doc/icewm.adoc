This document is the documentation for the *IceWM* X11 window manager.
It is still incomplete. IceWM and its documentation is
covered by a GNU LGPL license, which is included in the distribution.

== Introduction

The goal of IceWM is to provide a small, fast and familiar window
manager for the X11 window system. Compatibility with the
EWMH and ICCCM window manager protocols is desired and will
be implemented where appropriate.

IceWM originally was designed to emulate the look of Motif,
OS/2 Warp 4, OS/2 Warp 3 and Windows 95.
Since it has a theming engine others styles are possible.

Generally, it tries to make all functions available both by keyboard
and by mouse (this is not currently possible when using mouse focus).
Extreme configurability was not the goal.

Further information can be found at
http://www.icewm.org/[the icewm website]
and at
http://icewm.sourceforge.net/[SourceForge].

== First steps

=== IceWM components

The IceWM suite consists of the following core applications provided by
the main package:

* *icewm* - The actual window manager binary.
It handles window placement and draws the window decorations.
* *icewmbg* - The background setting application. It can assign plain
background color or images in different formats to the X background.
Either shared or separate for different workspaces.
This program should be started before `icewm`.
* *icewmtray* - Catches the Docklet objects installed by various
applications like PSI.
* *icewm-session* - The IceWM session manager. It runs all of the above. 
This is the preferred program to start IceWM.
* *icewm-menu-gnome2* - This is used internally.
It generates IceWM program menus from
FreeDesktop .desktop files (KDE/GNOME(2) menus).
* *icewmhint* - Used internally.

=== Starting icewm

The `icewm-session`, `icewm`, `icewmbg` and `icewmtray` executables
must be in your path for the restart function to work correctly.
The `icewm` program alone is suitable for use
with desktop environments like GNOME.

If you wish to run the whole IceWM suite (WM, background changer,
Docklet support, and startup/shutdown script handling), use the
`icewm-session` binary instead of pure `icewm`. Note that this is
not a complete Session Manager but it helps to automate the startup.

First make sure that you choose the correct
http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/XWindow-User-HOWTO/runningx.html[X startup]
script in your home directory.
For most distributions either the file `$HOME/.xsession`
or `$HOME/.xinitrc` is honored by startx and X display managers like KDM.
On RedHat, the `$HOME/.Xclients` may be used instead.
In all cases, choose the one
recommended by your distribution and make sure that there
is no concurrency between the X startup scripts.
Ensure that the script is executable. 
Mine looks something like this:

....
#!/bin/bash
# run profile to set $PATH and other env vars correctly
. $HOME/.bash_profile
# setup touchpad and the external mouse
xset m 7 2
xinput set-ptr-feedback 0 7 1.9 1

# start icewm-session
exec icewm-session
xterm
....

The xterm on the last line is there simply to make sure that your X
session doesn't crash if icewm does (should never happen). You can
restart icewm from there or start some other window manager. The
session will close if you close the xterm.

=== Startup and shutdown scripts

After initialization `icewm-session` will search
the resource path for a `startup` script.
If this file is found and if it is executable
`icewm-session` will run this script.
During termination of `icewm-session`, the `shutdown` script is executed.
Additionally the flag `--with-gnome` is passed
if a GNOME session manager is detected.

Example `~/.icewm/startup` script:
....
#!/bin/bash

[ -x ~/.icewm/restart ] && source ~/.icewm/restart

gnome-terminal --geometry 80x25+217+235 &
xscreensaver &
....

Hint: this feature is meant for easy desktop initialization
and it is part of IceWM due to popular demand.
For more sophisticated session management 
one could use a real session manager.
IceWM supports the XSESSION protocol.

=== Extra session environment

Please note that if icewm-session is used as the only startup mechanism
(without having .xsession involved), one can write additional environment
settings into the file `$HOME/.icewm/env` but this only supports simple assignments.
This means: no multiline is supported, no redundant whitespaces, no POSIX shell code; however,
expansion of simple shell style variables should be supported on most
platforms). This extra environment is only effective in applications started by
icewm-session and their subprocesses.

Example (env):
....
PATH=~/bin:$PATH
LANG=de_DE.UTF-8
....

== Focus models

IceWM implements four general focus models:

clickToRaise:: Exactly like Win95, OS/2 Warp. When window
is clicked with a mouse, it is raised and activated.

clickToFocus:: Window is raised and focused when titlebar or frame
border is clicked. Window is focused but not raised when window interior
is clicked.

pointerFocus::
When the mouse is moved, focus is set to window
under a mouse. It should be possible to change focus with the
keyboard when mouse is not moved.

explicitFocus::
When a window is clicked, it is activated, but not raised.
New windows do not automatically get the focus unless they
are transient windows for the active window.

Detailed configuration is possible using the configuration file options.

== Mouse Commands

=== Frame Commands

Left Button:: Select and raise the window. On the window frame, resize
the window.

Right Button:: When dragged, moves the window. When clicked, displays
the context menu.

=== Title Bar Commands

Any Button Drag:: Move the window.

Alt + Left Button:: Lower the window.

Left Button Double Click:: Maximize/Restore the window.

Middle Button Double Click:: Rollup/Unroll the window.

The Ctrl key can be used together with a mouse button to prevent
a window from being raised to the top of the stack.

=== Taskbar commands

Left Button Click:: Activate the workspace with the window and raise the window.
Toggles the minimized/active state of the window.
Shift + Left Button Click:: Move window to current workspace. This only works when windows from all workspaces are shown on the taskbar all the time.
Control + Left Button Click:: Minimize/restore the window.
Middle Button Click:: Toggle raised/lowered state of the window.
Shift + Middle Button Click:: Add the window to the current workspace.
Control + Middle Button Click:: Lower the window.
Right Button Click:: Display a context menu.

== Keyboard Commands

The Alt key is assumed to be the key defined as the Mod1 modifier.

Alt+F1:: Raise the window.
Alt+F2:: Make a window occupy all desktops.
Alt+F3:: Lower the window to the bottom of the stack.
Alt+F4:: Close the window.
Alt+F5:: Restore the window state if maximized or minimized/hidden.
Alt+F6:: Focus to next window.
Alt+Shift+F6:: Focus to previous window.
Alt+F7:: Move the window.
Alt+F8:: Resize the window.
Alt+F9:: Minimize the window to taskbar.
Alt+F10:: Maximize the window.
Alt+Shift+F10:: Maximize the window vertically (toggle).
Alt+F11:: Hide the window (appears in window list, but not on taskbar).
Alt+F12:: Rollup the window.
Ctrl+Escape:: Show the start menu.
Ctrl+Alt+Escape:: Show the window list.
Shift+Escape:: Show the system-menu of the window.
Alt+Escape:: Focus to next window (down in zorder)
Alt+Shift+Escape:: Focus to previous window (up in zorder)
Alt+Tab:: Switch between windows (top->bottom).
Alt+Shift+Tab:: Switch between windows (bottom->top).
Ctrl+Alt+LeftArrow:: Switch to the previous workspace (cycle).
Ctrl+Alt+RightArrow:: Switch to the next workspace (cycle).
Ctrl+Alt+DownArrow:: Switch to the previously active workspace.
Ctrl+Alt+Shift+LeftArrow:: Move the focused window to the previous workspace and activate it.
Ctrl+Alt+Shift+RightArrow:: Move the focused window to the next workspace and activate it.
Ctrl+Alt+Shift+DownArrow:: Move the focused window to the previously active workspace and activate it.
Ctrl+Alt+Delete:: displays the session dialog.
Ctrl+Alt+Space:: Activate the internal taskbar command line for starting applications. (Ctrl+Enter to run in a terminal window)

== The Resource Path

IceWM looks in several locations for configuration
information, themes and customization;
together these locations are called the resource path.
The resource path contains the following directories:

$HOME/.icewm::
this is the user's personal customization. This location can
be customized by setting the ICEWM_PRIVCFG environment variable.
/etc/icewm::
the system-wide defaults directory
/usr/share/icewm OR /usr/local/share/icewm::
the compiled-in default directory with default files

The directories are searched in the above order, so any file located
in the system/install directory can be overridden by the user by creating
the same directory hierarchy under `$HOME/.icewm`.

To customize icewm yourself, you should create the `$HOME/.icewm`
directory and copy the files that you wish to modify
(like `preferences`, `winoptions`), from `/etc/icewm`,
`/usr/share/icewm` or `/usr/local/share/icewm` and then modify as you like.

To customize the default themes, create the `$HOME/.icewm/themes` directory
and copy all the theme files there and then modify as necessary.

== Configuration Files

IceWM uses the following configuration files:

theme:: Currently selected theme
preferences:: General settings - paths, colors, fonts...
prefoverride:: Settings that should override the themes.
menu:: Menu of startable applications.  Usually customized by the user.
programs:: Automatically generated menu of startable applications (this should be used for *wmconfig*, *menu* or similar packages, perhaps as a part of the login or X startup sequence).
winoptions:: Application window options
keys:: Global keybindings to launch applications (not window manager related)
toolbar:: Quick launch application icons on the taskbar.

== Theme

File `~/.icewm/theme` contains the currently selected theme.
It will be overwritten automatically when a theme is
selected from the Themes menu.

== Preferences

This section shows preferences that can be set in `~/.icewm/preferences`.
Themes will not be able to override these settings.
Default values are shown following the equal sign.

New in 1.2.14: when IceWM is configured with--enable-xfreetype, only the settings with "Xft" suffix will be used. They specifiy the font name in fontconfig format:

....
MenuFontNameXft="sans-serif:size=12:bold"
....

=== Colors

ColorActiveBorder:: Color of the active window border.
...:: TODO (see default preferences for complete list)

=== Desktop Background

DesktopBackgroundColor:: Color of the desktop background.
DesktopBackgroundImage:: Image (.xpm) for desktop background. If you want icewm
to ignore the desktop background image / color set both DesktopBackgroundColor ad
DesktopBackgroundImage to an empty value ("").
DesktopBackgroundCenter = 0:: Display desktop background centered and
not tiled. (set to 0 or 1).

=== Task Bar

TaskBarClockLeds = 1:: Display clock using LCD style pixmaps.

== Menus and Toolbar

=== menu

Within the menu configuration file you can configure
which programs are to appear in the root/start menu.

=== toolbar

The Toolbar configuration file is used to put programs as buttons
on the taskbar.

=== programs

Usually automatically generated menu configuration file of installed programs. The
`programs` file should be automatically generated by `wmconfig` (Redhat),
`menu` (Debian) or an equivalent program (kde2ice and gno2ice to convert
GNOME/KDE Menu hierarchy are available).

Programs can be added using the following syntax:
....
prog "title" icon_name program_executable options
....

Restarting another window manager can be done using the restart program:
....
restart "title" icon_name program_executable options
....

icon_name can be `-` if icon is not wanted.

The "runonce" keyword allows to launch an application only when no window
has the WM_CLASS hint specified. Otherwise the first window having this
class hint is mapped and raised. Syntax:
....
runonce "title" icon_name "res_name.res_class" program_executable options
runonce "title" icon_name "res_name" program_executable options
runonce "title" icon_name ".res_class" program_executable options
....
The class hint can be figured out by running
....
$ xprop | grep WM_CLASS
....

Submenus can be added using the following syntax:
....
menu "title" icon_name {
# contained items
}
....

Only double quotes are interpreted by icewm. IceWM doesn't run the shell
automatically, so you may have to do that.

== Hot Keys 

IceWM allows launching of arbitrary programs with any key combination. This is
configured in the `keys` file.  The syntax of this file is like:

*key* "key combination" program options...

For example:
....
key  "Alt+Ctrl+t"  xterm -rv
....

== Window Options

*winoptions* file is used to configure settings for individual application windows.

Each line in the file must be in one of the possible formats:

* window_class.window_name.window_role.option: argument
* window_class.window_name.option: argument
* window_class.window_role.option: argument
* window_name.window_role.option: argument
* window_class.option: argument
* window_name.option: argument
* window_role.option: argument

Each window on the desktop has (should) *class* and *name* resources associated with it. Some more recent applications will also have a *window role* resource, though not all do.
They can be determined using the `xprop` utility.

`xprop` should display a line like this when used on a toplevel window:
....
WM_CLASS = "name", "class"
....
and may also display a line like this:
....
WM_WINDOW_ROLE = "window role"
....

It's possible that an application's *class* and/or *name* contains the dot character (".") used by IceWM to separate *class*, *name* and *role* values. To lock it, precede it with the backslash character. In the following example, we suppose an application's window has *the.class* as its *class* value and *the.name* as its *name* value :

....
class.name.option: argument
....

Options that can be set per window are as follows:

icon:: The name of the icon.
workspace:: Default workspace for window (number, counting from 0)
layer:: Default layer for the window. Layer can be one of the following strings:

Desktop:: Desktop window. There should be only one window in this layer.
Below:: Below default layer.
Normal:: Default layer for the windows.
OnTop:: Above the default.
Dock:: Layer for windows docked to the edge of the screen.
AboveDock:: Layer for the windows above the dock.
Menu:: Layer for the windows above the dock.

You can also use the numbers from `WinMgr.h`.

geometry::
The default geometry for the window. This geometry should be
specified in the usual X11-geometry-syntax, formal notation:
....
    [=][<width>{xX}<height>][{+-}<xoffset>{+-}<yoffset>]
....

tray::
The default tray option for the window.
This affects both the tray and the task pane.
Tray can be one of the following strings:
Ignore::: Don't add an icon to the tray pane.
Minimized::: Add an icon the the tray. Remove the task pane button when minimized.
Exclusive::: Add an icon the the tray. Never create a task pane button .

allWorkspaces=0:: If set to 1, window will be visible on all workspaces.
ignoreWinList=0:: If set to 1, window will not appear in the window list.
ignoreTaskBar=0:: If set to 1, window will not appear on the task bar.
ignoreQuickSwitch=0:: If set to 1, window will not be accessible using QuickSwitch feature (Alt+Tab).
fullKeys=0:: If set to 1, the window manager leave more keys (Alt+F?) to the application.
fMove=1:: If set to 0, window will not be movable.
fResize=1:: If set to 0, window will not be resizable.
fClose=1:: If set to 0, window will not be closable.
fMinimize=1:: If set to 0, window will not be minimizable.
fMaximize=1:: If set to 0, window will not be maximizable.
fHide=1:: If set to 0, window will not be hidable.
fRollup=1:: If set to 0, window will not be shadable.
dTitleBar=1:: If set to 0, window will not have a title bar.
dSysMenu=1:: If set to 0, window will not have a system menu.
dBorder=1:: If set to 0, window will not have a border.
dResize=1:: If set to 0, window will not have a resize border.
dClose=1:: If set to 0, window will not have a close button.
dMinimize=1:: If set to 0, window will not have a minimize button.
dMaximize=1:: If set to 0, window will not have a maximize button.
noFocusOnAppRaise:: if set to 1, window will not automatically get focus as
application raises it.
ignoreNoFocusHint:: if set to 1, icewm will focus even if the window does not
handle input.
doNotCover=0:: if set to 1, this window will limit the workspace available for
regular applications. window has to be sticky at the moment to make it work
forcedClose=0:: if set to 1 and the application had not registered
WM_DELETE_WINDOW, a close confirmation dialog won't be offered upon closing
the window.

== Icon handling

=== Generic

The window manager expects to find two XPM files for each icon
specified in the configuration files as _ICON_. They should be named like
this:

ICON_16x16.xpm:: A small 16x16 pixmap.
ICON_32x32.xpm:: A normal 32x32 pixmap.
ICON_48x48.xpm:: A large 48x48 pixmap.

Other pixmap sizes like 20x20, 24x24, 40x40, 48x48, 64x64 might be used
in the future. Perhaps we need a file format that can contain
more than one image (with different sizes and color depths) like
Windows'95 and OS/2 .ICO files.

It would be nice to have a feature from OS/2 that varies the icon size
with screen resolution (16x16 and 32x32 icons are quite small on 4000x4000
screens ;-)

=== Imlib
When compiled with the Imlib image library all of Imlib's image formats 
(bmp, jpeg, ppm, tiff, gif, png, ps, xpm on my machine) are supported. 
Use them by specifying the full filename or an absolute path:

ICON.bmp:: A PPM icon in your IconPath.
/usr/share/pixmap/ICON.png:: An PNG image with absolute location.

== Mouse cursors

IceWM scans the theme and configuration directories for a subdirectory called
_cursors_ containing monochrome but transparent XPM files. To change the
mouse cursor you have to use this filenames:

left.xbm:: Default cursor (usually pointer to the left).

== Themes

Themes are used to configure the way the window manager looks. Things
like fonts, colors, border sizes, button pixmaps can be
configured. Put together they form a theme.

Theme files are searched in the `themes`
subdirectories.

These directories contain other directories that contain related theme files and
their .xpm files. Each theme file specifies fonts, colors, border sizes, ...

The theme to use is specified in `~/.icewm/theme` file:

Theme = "nice/default.theme"::
Name of the theme to use. Both the directory
and theme file name must be specified.

If the theme directory contains a file named _fonts.dir_ created by       
mkfontdir the theme directory is inserted into the X servers font search path.

(http://themes.freshmeat.net/[freshmeat] used to contain various nice themes created by users of IceWM.)
