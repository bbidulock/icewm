[#introduction]
== Introduction

This document is the manual for the *IceWM* X11 window manager.
The IceWM manpages provide additional documentation.

The goal of IceWM is to provide a small, fast and familiar window
manager for the X11 window system, which is compatible with the
EWMH and ICCCM window manager protocols. Generally, it tries to make
all functions available both by keyboard and by mouse (this is not
currently possible when using mouse focus).

IceWM originally was designed to emulate the look of Motif, OS/2
Warp 4, OS/2 Warp 3 and Windows 95. Since it has a theming engine
others styles are possible. A large number of original themes have
been created and https://themes.ice-wm.org[published by users].

Further information can be found at https://ice-wm.org[the IceWM
website],
at the https://github.com/bbidulock/icewm/[current site of
development],
which includes the https://github.com/bbidulock/icewm/issues/[support
requests].

[#icewm-components]
=== IceWM components

The IceWM suite consists of the following core applications provided
by the main package:

* *https://ice-wm.org/man/icewm.html[icewm]* - The actual window
manager binary. It handles window placement and draws the window
decorations.
* *https://ice-wm.org/man/icewmbg.html[icewmbg]* - The background
setting application. It can assign plain background color or images in
different formats to the X background. Either shared or separate for
different workspaces. This program should be started before `icewm`.
* *https://ice-wm.org/man/icewm-session.html[icewm-session]* - The
IceWM session manager runs all of the above. This is the preferred
program to start IceWM.
* *https://ice-wm.org/man/icewm-menu-fdo.html[icewm-menu-fdo]* -
This generates IceWM program menus from FreeDesktop `.desktop` files.
* *https://ice-wm.org/man/icewmhint.html[icewmhint]* - Is a simple
utility for passing IceWM hints to IceWM by window class and
instance. Icewmhint uses a special property, '"_ICEWM_WINOPHINT"',
on the root window to pass special hints to IceWM.
* *https://ice-wm.org/man/icehelp.html[icehelp]* - Is used by icewm
to display the 'IceWM manual' and the manpages. See the output of
`icehelp --help` for details.
* *https://ice-wm.org/man/icesh.html[icesh]* - Could be used to manage
IceWM internals from the command line.

[#starting-icewm]
=== Starting icewm

The `icewm` program alone is suitable for use with desktop environments
like GNOME. If you wish to run the whole IceWM suite (WM, background
changer, Docklet support, and startup/shutdown script handling), use
the `icewm-session` binary instead of pure `icewm`. Note that this
is not a complete Session Manager but it helps to automate the startup.

First make sure that you choose the correct
https://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/XWindow-User-HOWTO/runningx.html[X startup]
script in your home directory. For most distributions either the
file `$HOME/.xsession` or `$HOME/.xinitrc` is honored by startx and
X display managers like KDM. On RedHat, the `$HOME/.Xclients` may
be used instead. In all cases, choose the one recommended by your
distribution and make sure that there is no concurrency between the
X startup scripts. Ensure that the script is executable. Mine looks
something like this:

....
#!/bin/bash
# run profile to set $PATH and other env vars correctly
. $HOME/.bash_profile
# setup touchpad and the external mouse
xset m 7 2
xinput set-ptr-feedback 0 7 1.9 1

# start icewm-session
exec icewm-session
xterm
....

The xterm on the last line is there simply to make sure that your X
session doesn't crash if IceWM does (should never happen). You can
restart IceWM from there or start some other window manager. The
session will close if you close the xterm.

[#startup-and-shutdown-scripts]
=== Startup and shutdown scripts

After initialization `icewm-session` will search the resource
path for a `startup` script. If this file is found and if it is
executable `icewm-session` will run this script. During termination of
`icewm-session` the `shutdown` script is executed.

Example `~/.icewm/startup` script:

....
#!/bin/bash

[ -x ~/.icewm/restart ] && source ~/.icewm/restart

gnome-terminal --geometry 80x25+217+235 &
xscreensaver &
....

On termination the `shutdown` script will be run first, then
`icewm-session` will terminate icewm and icewmbg.

TIP: `icewm-session` is meant for easy desktop initialization and it
is part of IceWM due to popular demand. For more sophisticated session
management one could use a real session manager. IceWM supports the
XSESSION protocol.

[#extra-session-environment]
=== Extra session environment

Please note that if icewm-session is used as the only startup mechanism
(without having .xsession involved), one can write additional
environment settings into the file `$HOME/.icewm/env`. Expansion
of simple shell style variables should be supported on most
platforms. Shell command expansion is supported if `wordexp` was
configured. This extra environment is only effective in applications
started by icewm-session and their subprocesses.

Example `env`:

 PATH=~/bin:$PATH
 LANG=de_DE.UTF-8

[#focus-models]
== Focus models

IceWM implements four general focus models:

* *clickToRaise*
+
Exactly like Win95, OS/2 Warp. When window is clicked with a mouse,
it is raised and activated.

* *clickToFocus*
+
Window is raised and focused when titlebar or frame border is
clicked. Window is focused but not raised when window interior
is clicked.

* *pointerFocus*
+
When the mouse is moved, focus is set to window under a mouse. It
should be possible to change focus with the keyboard when mouse is
not moved.

* *explicitFocus*
+
When a window is clicked, it is activated, but not raised. New windows
do not automatically get the focus unless they are transient windows
for the active window.

Detailed configuration is possible using the configuration file
options.

[#mouse-commands]
== Mouse Commands

[#frame-commands]
=== Frame Commands

* *Left Button*
+

execute the command otherwise `/bin/sh` is used. If the *Control*
key was also pressed then the command is executed in a terminal
as given by *TerminalCommand*. The address bar maintains a history
which is navigable by the Up and Down keys. A rich set of editing
operations is supported, including cut-/copy-/paste-operations and
file completion using *Tab* or *Ctrl-I*.

[#the-resource-path]
== The Resource Path

IceWM looks in several locations for configuration information,
themes and customization; together these locations are called the
resource path. The resource path contains the following directories:

$ICEWM_PRIVCFG; $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/icewm; $HOME/.icewm
The first of these which is defined and existent is used to search
for the user's personal customization.

/etc/icewm
the system-wide defaults directory

/usr/share/icewm OR /usr/local/share/icewm
the compiled-in default directory with default files

The directories are searched in the above order, so any file located
in the system/install directory can be overridden by the user by
creating the same directory hierarchy under `$HOME/.icewm`.

To customize icewm yourself, you could create the `$HOME/.icewm`
directory and copy the files that you wish to modify, like
`preferences`, `keys` or `winoptions`, from `/etc/icewm`,
`/usr/share/icewm` or `/usr/local/share/icewm` and then modify as
you like.

To customize the default themes, create the `$HOME/.icewm/themes`
directory and copy all the theme files there and then modify as
necessary. Each theme has its own subdirectory. Themes can be
downloaded from https://themes.ice-wm.org.

[#configuration-files]

[#mailbox-monitoring-updated-2018-03-04]
=== Mailbox Monitoring (updated 2018-03-04)

* `MailBoxPath = ""`

This may contain a list of mailbox specifications. Mailboxes are
separated by a space. If `TaskBarShowMailboxStatus` is enabled
then IceWM will monitor each mailbox for status changes each
`MailCheckDelay` seconds. For each mailbox IceWM will show an icon on
the taskbar. The icon shows if there is mail, if there is unread mail,
or if there is new mail. Hovering the mouse pointer over an icon shows
the number of messages in this mailbox and also the number unread
mails. A mailbox can be the path to a file in conventional _mbox_
format. If the path points to a directory then _Maildir_ format is
assumed. Remote mail boxes are specified by an URL using the Common
Internet Scheme Syntax (RFC 1738):

 scheme://user:password@server[:port][/path]

Supported schemes are `pop3`, `pop3s`, `imap`, `imaps` and `file`. The
`pop3s` and `imaps` schemes depend on the presence of the `openssl`
command for `TLS/SSL` encryption. This is also the case if `port` is
either `993` for imap or `995` for pop3. When the scheme is omitted
then `file` is assumed. IMAP subfolders can be given by the path
component. Reserved characters like _slash_, _at_ and _colon_ can
be specified using escape sequences with a hexadecimal encoding like
`%2f` for the slash or `%40` for the at sign. For example:

 file:///var/spool/mail/captnmark
 file:///home/captnmark/Maildir/
 pop3://markus:%2f%40%3a@maol.ch/
 pop3s://markus:password@pop.gmail.com/
 imap://mathias@localhost/INBOX.Maillisten.icewm-user
 imaps://mathias:password@imap.gmail.com/INBOX

To help solve network protocol errors for pop3 and imap set the
environment variable `ICEWM_MAILCHECK_TRACE`. IceWM will then log
communication details for POP3 and IMAP mailboxes. Just set `export
ICEWM_MAILCHECK_TRACE=1` before executing icewm, or set this in the
`env` configuration file.

Note that for IceWM to access Gmail you must first configure your Gmail
account to enable POP3 or IMAP access. To allow non-Gmail applications
like IceWM to use it see the Gmail help site for "Let less secure
apps use your account". Also set secure file permissions on your
IceWM preferences file and the directory which contains it. It is
unwise to store a password on file ever. Consider a wallet extension
for IceWM. The following Perl snippet demonstrates how to hex encode
a password like `!p@a%s&s~`:

 $ perl -e 'foreach(split("", $ARGV[0])) { printf "%%%02x", ord($_);  }; print "\n";' '!p@a%s&s~'
 %21%40%23%24%25%5e%26%2a%7e

[#menus-and-toolbar-updated-2018-05-06]
== Menus and Toolbar (updated 2018-05-06)

[#menu]
=== menu

Within the `menu` configuration file you can configure which programs
are to appear in the root/start menu.

Submenus can be created with:

 menu "title" icon_name {
 # contained items
 }
 separator
 menufile "title" icon_name filename
 menuprog "title" icon_name program arguments
 menuprogreload "title" icon_name timeout program arguments
 include filename
 includeprog program arguments

Menus can be populated with submenus and with program entries as
explained below for the `program` configuration file. Comments start
with a #-sign.

The `menufile` directive creates a submenu with a title and an
icon, while `menuprog` and `menuprogreload` create a submenu with
entries from the output of `program arguments` where the timeout
of `menuprogreload` says to reload the submenu after the timeout
expires. The `include` statement loads more configuration from the
given filename, while `includeprog` runs `program arguments` to parse
the output.

[#toolbar]
=== toolbar

The `toolbar` configuration file is used to put programs as buttons
on the taskbar. It uses the same syntax as the `menu` file.

[#programs-2]
=== programs

Usually automatically generated menu configuration file of installed
programs. The `programs` file should be automatically generated by
`wmconfig` (Redhat), `menu` (Debian), or `icewm-menu-fdo`.

Programs can be added using the following syntax:

 prog "title" icon_name program_executable options

Restarting another window manager can be done using the restart
program:

 restart "title" icon_name program_executable options

icon_name can be `-` if icon is not wanted, or `!` if the icon name
shall be guessed by checking the command (i.e. the real executable
file, following symlinks as needed).

The "runonce" keyword allows to launch an application only when no
window has the WM_CLASS hint specified. Otherwise the first window
having this class hint is mapped and raised. Syntax:

 runonce "title" icon_name "res_name.res_class" program_executable
 options
 runonce "title" icon_name "res_name" program_executable options
 runonce "title" icon_name ".res_class" program_executable options

The class hint of an application window can be figured out by running

 $ xprop WM_CLASS

Submenus can be added using the same keywords as the `menu`
configuration file.

Only double quotes are interpreted by IceWM. IceWM doesn't run the
shell automatically, so you may have to do that.

[#hot-keys]
== Hot Keys

IceWM allows launching of arbitrary programs with any key
combination. This is configured in the `keys` file. The syntax of
this file is like:

*key* "key combination" program options...

For example:

 key  "Alt+Ctrl+t"  xterm -rv
 key "Ctrl+Shift+r" icewm --restart
 runonce "Alt+F12"  "res_name.res_class" program_executable options

[#window-options-updated-2018-03-04]
== Window Options (updated 2018-03-04)

The *winoptions* file is used to configure settings for individual
application windows. Each line in this file must have one of the
following formats:

* **  window_name.window_class.option: argument**
* **  window_name.window_role.option: argument**
* **  window_class.option: argument**
* **  window_name.option: argument**
* **  window_role.option: argument**
* **  .option: argument**

The last format sets a default option value for all windows. Each
window on the desktop should have *name* and *class* resources
associated with it. Some applications also have a *window role*
resource. They can be determined using the `xprop` utility. When used
on a toplevel window, `xprop | grep -e CLASS -e ROLE` should output
a line like this:

 WM_CLASS = "name", "Class"

and may also display a line like this:

 WM_WINDOW_ROLE = "window role"

It's possible that an application's *name* and/or *class* contains
a dot character (*.*), which is also used by IceWM to separate
*name*, *class* and *role* values. In this case precede the dot
with the backslash character. In the following example, we suppose
an application's window has `the.name` as its *name* value and
`The.Class` as its *class* value and for this combination we set
*option* to *argument*.

 the\.name.The\.Class.option: argument

Options that can be set per window are as follows:

* *icon*
+
The name of the icon.

* *workspace*
+
Default workspace for window (number, counting from 0)

* *layer*
+
The default stacking layer for the window. Layer can be one of the
following seven strings:

 ** _Desktop_
Desktop window. There should be only one window in this layer.
 ** _Below_
Below default layer.
 ** _Normal_
Default layer for the windows.
 ** _OnTop_
Above the default.
 ** _Dock_
Layer for windows docked to the edge of the screen.
 ** _AboveDock_
Layer for the windows above the dock.
 ** _Menu_
Layer for the windows above the dock.

+
You can also use a number from 0 to 15.

* *geometry*
+
The default geometry for the window. This geometry should be specified
in the usual X11-geometry-syntax, formal notation:

   [=][<width>{xX}<height>][{+-}<xoffset>{+-}<yoffset>]

* *tray*
+
The default tray option for the window. This affects both the tray
and the task pane. Tray can be one of the following strings:

 ** _Ignore_
Don't add an icon to the tray pane.
 ** _Minimized_
Add an icon the the tray. Remove the task pane button when minimized.
 ** _Exclusive_
Add an icon the the tray. Never create a task pane button.

* *order: 0*

[#icon-handling]
== Icon handling

[#generic]
=== Generic

The window manager expects to find two XPM files for each icon
specified in the configuration files as _ICON_. They should be named
like this:

* *ICON_16x16.xpm*
+
A small 16x16 pixmap.

* *ICON_32x32.xpm*
+
A normal 32x32 pixmap.

* *ICON_48x48.xpm*
+
A large 48x48 pixmap.

Other pixmap sizes like 20x20, 24x24, 40x40, 48x48, 64x64 might be
used in the future. Perhaps we need a file format that can contain
more than one image (with different sizes and color depths) like
Windows'95 and OS/2 .ICO files.

It would be nice to have a feature from OS/2 that varies the icon
size with screen resolution (16x16 and 32x32 icons are quite small
on 4000x4000 screens ;-)

[#gdk-pixbuf]
=== GDK-Pixbuf

When icewm was configured with the `--enable-gdk-pixbuf` option all
of GdkPixbuf's image formats are supported. Use them by specifying
the full filename or an absolute path:

* *ICON.bmp*
+
A PPM icon in your IconPath.

* */usr/share/pixmap/ICON.png*
+
An PNG image with absolute location.

[#mouse-cursors]
== Mouse cursors

IceWM scans the theme and configuration directories for a subdirectory
called _cursors_ containing monochrome but transparent XPM files. To
change the mouse cursor you have to use this filenames:

* *left.xbm*
+
Default cursor (usually pointer to the left).

* *right.xbm*
+
Menu cursor (usually pointer to the right).

* *move.xbm*
+
Window movement cursor.

* *sizeTL.xbm*
+
Cursor when you resize the window by top left.

* *sizeT.xbm*
+
Cursor when you resize the window by top.

* *sizeTR.xbm*
+
Cursor when you resize the window by top right.

* *sizeL.xbm*
+
Cursor when you resize the window by left.

* *sizeR.xbm*
+
Cursor when you resize the window by right.

* *sizeBL.xbm*
+
Cursor when you resize the window by bottom left.

* *sizeB.xbm*
+
Cursor when you resize the window by bottom.

* *sizeBR.xbm*
+
Cursor when you resize the window by bottom right.

[#themes]
== Themes

Themes are used to configure the way the window manager looks. Things
like fonts, colors, border sizes, button pixmaps can be configured. Put
together they form a theme.

Theme files are searched in the `themes` subdirectories.

These directories contain other directories that contain related
theme files and their .xpm files. Each theme file specifies fonts,
colors, border sizes, ...

The theme to use is specified in `~/.icewm/theme` file:

* `Theme = "nice/default.theme"`
+
Name of the theme to use. Both the directory and theme file name must
be specified.

If the theme directory contains a file named _fonts.dir_ created by
mkfontdir the theme directory is inserted into the X servers font
search path.

https://themes.ice-wm.org[www.box-look.org] has a very large number
of themes which were created by users of IceWM.

[#command-line-options]
== Command Line Options

`icewm` supports the following options:

----
-d, --display=NAME
NAME of the X server to use.

--client-id=ID
Client id to use when contacting session manager.

--sync
Synchronize X11 commands.

-c, --config=FILE
Load preferences from FILE.

-t, --theme=FILE
Load theme from FILE.

--postpreferences
Print preferences after all processing.

-V, --version
Prints version information and exits.

-h, --help
Prints this usage screen and exits.

--replace
Replace an existing window manager.

-r, --restart
Tell the running icewm to restart itself.

--configured
Print the compile time configuration.

--directories
Print the configuration directories.

-l, --list-themes
Print a list of all available themes.
----

The restart option can be used to reload the IceWM configuration
after modifications. It is the preferred way to restart IceWM from
the command line or in scripts. To load a different theme from the
command line, combine this with the `--theme=NAME` option like:

 icewm -r -t CrystalBlue

The theme name will then be saved to the 'theme' configuration file,
before restarting IceWM.
