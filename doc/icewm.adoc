This document is the manual for the *IceWM* X11 window manager.
The IceWM manpages provide additional documentation.
IceWM and its documentation are covered by a GNU LGPL license,
which is included in the distribution.

== Introduction

The goal of IceWM is to provide a small, fast and familiar window
manager for the X11 window system, which is compatible
with the EWMH and ICCCM window manager protocols.
Generally, it tries to make all functions available both by keyboard
and by mouse (this is not currently possible when using mouse focus).

IceWM originally was designed to emulate the look of Motif,
OS/2 Warp 4, OS/2 Warp 3 and Windows 95.
Since it has a theming engine others styles are possible.
A large number of original themes have been created and
https://www.box-look.org/browse/cat/142/ord/latest/[published by users].

Further information can be found at
https://ice-wm.org/[the IceWM website],
and at the
https://github.com/bbidulock/icewm/[current site of development],
which includes the
https://github.com/bbidulock/icewm/issues/[support requests].

== First steps

=== IceWM components

The IceWM suite consists of the following core applications provided by
the main package:

* *icewm* - The actual window manager binary.
It handles window placement and draws the window decorations.
* *icewmbg* - The background setting application. It can assign plain
background color or images in different formats to the X background.
Either shared or separate for different workspaces.
This program should be started before `icewm`.
* *icewm-session* - The IceWM session manager runs all of the above.
This is the preferred program to start IceWM.
* *icewm-menu-fdo* -
This generates IceWM program menus from FreeDesktop `.desktop` files.
* *icewmhint* - Is a simple utility for passing IceWM hints to IceWM
by window class and instance.
Icewmhint uses a special property, '"_ICEWM_WINOPHINT"',
on the root window to pass special hints to IceWM.
* *icehelp* - Is used by icewm to display the 'IceWM manual' and the manpages.
See the output of `icehelp --help` for details.
* *icesh* - Could be used to manage IceWM internals from the command line.

=== Starting icewm

The `icewm` program alone is suitable for use
with desktop environments like GNOME.
If you wish to run the whole IceWM suite (WM, background changer,
Docklet support, and startup/shutdown script handling), use the
`icewm-session` binary instead of pure `icewm`. Note that this is
not a complete Session Manager but it helps to automate the startup.

First make sure that you choose the correct
http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/XWindow-User-HOWTO/runningx.html[X startup]
script in your home directory.
For most distributions either the file `$HOME/.xsession`
or `$HOME/.xinitrc` is honored by startx and X display managers like KDM.
On RedHat, the `$HOME/.Xclients` may be used instead.
In all cases, choose the one recommended by your distribution and
make sure that there is no concurrency between the X startup scripts.
Ensure that the script is executable.
Mine looks something like this:

....
#!/bin/bash
# run profile to set $PATH and other env vars correctly
. $HOME/.bash_profile
# setup touchpad and the external mouse
xset m 7 2
xinput set-ptr-feedback 0 7 1.9 1

# start icewm-session
exec icewm-session
xterm
....

The xterm on the last line is there simply to make sure that your X
session doesn't crash if IceWM does (should never happen). You can
restart IceWM from there or start some other window manager. The
session will close if you close the xterm.

=== Startup and shutdown scripts

After initialization `icewm-session` will search
the resource path for a `startup` script.
If this file is found and if it is executable
`icewm-session` will run this script.
During termination of `icewm-session` the `shutdown` script is executed.

Example `~/.icewm/startup` script:
....
#!/bin/bash

[ -x ~/.icewm/restart ] && source ~/.icewm/restart

gnome-terminal --geometry 80x25+217+235 &
xscreensaver &
....

On termination the `shutdown` script will be run first,
then `icewm-session` will terminate icewm and icewmbg.

Hint: `icewm-session` is meant for easy desktop initialization
and it is part of IceWM due to popular demand.
For more sophisticated session management
one could use a real session manager.
IceWM supports the XSESSION protocol.

=== Extra session environment

Please note that if icewm-session is used as the only startup mechanism
(without having .xsession involved), one can write additional environment
settings into the file `$HOME/.icewm/env`.
Expansion of simple shell style variables should be supported on most
platforms. Shell command expansion is supported if `wordexp` was configured.
This extra environment is only effective in applications started by
icewm-session and their subprocesses.

Example `env`:
....
PATH=~/bin:$PATH
LANG=de_DE.UTF-8
....

== Focus models

IceWM implements four general focus models:

+clickToRaise+:: Exactly like Win95, OS/2 Warp. When window
is clicked with a mouse, it is raised and activated.

+clickToFocus+:: Window is raised and focused when titlebar or frame
border is clicked. Window is focused but not raised when window interior
is clicked.

+pointerFocus+::
When the mouse is moved, focus is set to window
under a mouse. It should be possible to change focus with the
keyboard when mouse is not moved.

+explicitFocus+::
When a window is clicked, it is activated, but not raised.
New windows do not automatically get the focus unless they
are transient windows for the active window.

Detailed configuration is possible using the configuration file options.

== Mouse Commands

=== Frame Commands

+Left Button+:: Select and raise the window. On the window frame, resize
the window.

+Right Button+:: When dragged, moves the window. When clicked, displays
the context menu.

=== Title Bar Commands

+Any Button Drag+:: Move the window.

+Alt + Left Button+:: Lower the window.

+Left Button Double Click+:: Maximize/Restore the window.

+Middle Button Double Click+:: Rollup/Unroll the window.

The Ctrl key can be used together with a mouse button to prevent
a window from being raised to the top of the stack.

=== Taskbar commands

+Left Button Click+:: Activate the workspace with the window and raise the window.
Toggles the minimized/active state of the window.
+Shift + Left Button Click+:: Move window to current workspace. This only works when windows from all workspaces are shown on the taskbar all the time.
+Control + Left Button Click+:: Minimize/restore the window.
+Middle Button Click+:: Toggle raised/lowered state of the window.
+Shift + Middle Button Click+:: Add the window to the current workspace.
+Control + Middle Button Click+:: Lower the window.
+Right Button Click+:: Display a context menu.

== Keyboard Commands

The Alt key is assumed to be the key defined as the Mod1 modifier.

`Alt+F1`:: Raise the window.
`Alt+F2`:: Make a window occupy all desktops.
`Alt+F3`:: Lower the window to the bottom of the stack.
`Alt+F4`:: Close the window.
`Alt+F5`:: Restore the window state if maximized or minimized/hidden.
`Alt+F6`:: Focus to next window.
`Alt+Shift+F6`:: Focus to previous window.
`Alt+F7`:: Starts movement of the active window.
Move the window either by the mouse or by the arrow keys.
The arrow keys can be accelerated four times by the Shift key
or sixteen times by the Control key.
Press the left button or the Enter key when done.
To cancel press Escape.
`Alt+F8`:: Starts resizing of the active window.
Resize the window either by the mouse or by the arrow keys.
The arrow keys can be accelerated four times by the Shift key
or sixteen times by the Control key.
Press the left button or the Enter key when done.
To cancel press Escape.
`Alt+F9`:: Minimize the window to taskbar.
`Alt+F10`:: Maximize the window.
`Alt+Shift+F10`:: Maximize the window vertically (toggle).
`Alt+F11`:: Hide the window (appears in window list, but not on taskbar).
`Alt+F12`:: Rollup the window.
`Ctrl+Escape`:: Show the start menu.
`Ctrl+Alt+Escape`:: Show the window list.
`Shift+Escape`:: Show the system-menu of the window.
`Alt+Escape`:: Focus to next window (down in zorder)
`Alt+Shift+Escape`:: Focus to previous window (up in zorder)
`Alt+Tab`:: Switch between windows (top->bottom).
`Alt+Shift+Tab`:: Switch between windows (bottom->top).
`Ctrl+Alt+LeftArrow`:: Switch to the previous workspace (cycle).
`Ctrl+Alt+RightArrow`:: Switch to the next workspace (cycle).
`Ctrl+Alt+DownArrow`:: Switch to the previously active workspace.
`Ctrl+Alt+Shift+LeftArrow`:: Move the focused window to the previous workspace and activate it.
`Ctrl+Alt+Shift+RightArrow`:: Move the focused window to the next workspace and activate it.
`Ctrl+Alt+Shift+DownArrow`:: Move the focused window to the previously active workspace and activate it.
`Ctrl+Alt+Delete`:: displays the session dialog.
`Ctrl+Alt+Space`:: Activate the AddressBar.
This is a command line in the taskbar where a shell command can be typed.
Pressing the Enter key will execute the command.
If *AddressBarCommand* was configured it will be used
to execute the command otherwise `/bin/sh` is used.
If the *Control* key was also pressed then the command
is executed in a terminal as given by *TerminalCommand*.
The address bar maintains a history which is
navigable by the Up and Down keys.
A rich set of editing operations is supported,
including cut-/copy-/paste-operations
and file completion using *Tab* or *Ctrl-I*.

== The Resource Path

IceWM looks in several locations for configuration
information, themes and customization;
together these locations are called the resource path.
The resource path contains the following directories:

+$ICEWM_PRIVCFG+::
+$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/icewm+::
+$HOME/.icewm+::
The first of these which is defined and existent
is used to search for the user's personal customization.
+/etc/icewm+::
the system-wide defaults directory
+/usr/share/icewm OR /usr/local/share/icewm+::
the compiled-in default directory with default files

The directories are searched in the above order, so any file located
in the system/install directory can be overridden by the user by creating
the same directory hierarchy under `$HOME/.icewm`.

To customize icewm yourself, you could create the `$HOME/.icewm`
directory and copy the files that you wish to modify,
like `preferences`, `keys` or `winoptions`, from
`/etc/icewm`, `/usr/share/icewm` or `/usr/local/share/icewm`
and then modify as you like.

To customize the default themes, create the `$HOME/.icewm/themes` directory
and copy all the theme files there and then modify as necessary.
Each theme has its own subdirectory.
Themes can be downloaded from https://www.box-look.org/.

== Configuration Files

IceWM uses the following configuration files:

+theme+:: Currently selected theme
+preferences+:: General settings - paths, colors, fonts...
+prefoverride+:: Settings that should override the themes.
+menu+:: Menu of startable applications.  Usually customized by the user.
+programs+:: Automatically generated menu of startable applications (this should be used for *wmconfig*, *menu* or similar packages, perhaps as a part of the login or X startup sequence).
+winoptions+:: Application window options
+keys+:: Global keybindings to launch applications (not window manager related)
+toolbar+:: Quick launch application icons on the taskbar.

== Theme

The `theme` file contains the currently selected theme.
It will be overwritten automatically when a theme is
selected from the Themes menu.

== Preferences

This section shows preferences that can be set in `preferences`.
Themes will not be able to override these settings.
Default values are shown following the equal sign.

=== Mailbox Monitoring (updated 2018-03-04)

+MailBoxPath = ""+::
  This may contain a list of mailbox specifications.
  Mailboxes are separated by a space.
  If `TaskBarShowMailboxStatus` is enabled then
  IceWM will monitor each mailbox for status changes
  each `MailCheckDelay` seconds.
  For each mailbox IceWM will show an icon on the taskbar.
  The icon shows if there is mail, if there is unread mail,
  or if there is new mail.
  Hovering the mouse pointer over an icon shows the number of
  messages in this mailbox and also the number unread mails.
  A mailbox can be the path to a file in conventional _mbox_ format.
  If the path points to a directory then _Maildir_ format is assumed.
  Remote mail boxes are specified by an URL
  using the Common Internet Scheme Syntax (RFC 1738):
+
    scheme://user:password@server[:port][/path]
::
  Supported schemes are `pop3`, `pop3s`, `imap`, `imaps` and `file`.
  The `pop3s` and `imaps` schemes depend on the presence
  of the `openssl` command for `TLS/SSL` encryption.
  This is also the case if `port` is either
  `993` for imap or `995` for pop3.
  When the scheme is omitted then `file` is assumed.
  IMAP subfolders can be given by the path component.
  Reserved characters like _slash_, _at_ and _colon_
  can be specified using escape sequences with a
  hexadecimal encoding like `%2f` for the slash
  or `%40` for the at sign.  For example:
+
    file:///var/spool/mail/captnmark
    file:///home/captnmark/Maildir/
    pop3://markus:%2f%40%3a@maol.ch/
    pop3s://markus:password@pop.gmail.com/
    imap://mathias@localhost/INBOX.Maillisten.icewm-user
    imaps://mathias:password@imap.gmail.com/INBOX
::
  To help solve network protocol errors for pop3 and imap
  set the environment variable `ICEWM_MAILCHECK_TRACE`.
  IceWM will then log communication details for POP3 and IMAP mailboxes.
  Just set `export ICEWM_MAILCHECK_TRACE=1` before executing icewm,
  or set this in the `env` configuration file.
::
  Note that for IceWM to access Gmail you must first configure
  your Gmail account to enable POP3 or IMAP access.
  To allow non-Gmail applications like IceWM to use it see the
  Gmail help site for "Let less secure apps use your account".
  Also set secure file permissions on your IceWM preferences file
  and the directory which contains it.
  It is unwise to store a password on file ever.
  Consider a wallet extension for IceWM.
  The following Perl snippet demonstrates how to
  hex encode a password like `!p@a%s&s~`:
+
    $ perl -e 'foreach(split("", $ARGV[0])) { printf "%%%02x", ord($_); }; print "\n";' '!p@a%s&s~'
    %21%40%23%24%25%5e%26%2a%7e

== Menus and Toolbar (updated 2018-05-06)

=== menu

Within the `menu` configuration file you can configure
which programs are to appear in the root/start menu.

Submenus can be created with:
....
menu "title" icon_name {
# contained items
}
separator
menufile "title" icon_name filename
menuprog "title" icon_name program arguments
menuprogreload "title" icon_name timeout program arguments
include filename
includeprog program arguments
....

Menus can be populated with submenus and with program entries
as explained below for the `program` configuration file.
Comments start with a +#+-sign.

The `menufile` directive creates a submenu with a title and an icon,
while `menuprog` and `menuprogreload` create a submenu with entries from
the output of `program arguments` where the timeout of `menuprogreload`
says to reload the submenu after the timeout expires.
The `include` statement loads more configuration from the given filename,
while `includeprog` runs `program arguments` to parse the output.

=== toolbar

The `toolbar` configuration file is used to put programs as buttons
on the taskbar. It uses the same syntax as the `menu` file.

=== programs

Usually automatically generated menu configuration file of installed programs. The
`programs` file should be automatically generated by `wmconfig` (Redhat),
`menu` (Debian) or an equivalent program (kde2ice and gno2ice to convert
GNOME/KDE Menu hierarchy are available).

Programs can be added using the following syntax:
....
prog "title" icon_name program_executable options
....

Restarting another window manager can be done using the restart program:
....
restart "title" icon_name program_executable options
....

icon_name can be `-` if icon is not wanted, or `!` if the icon name shall be guessed by checking the command (i.e. the real executable file, following symlinks as needed).

The "runonce" keyword allows to launch an application only when no window
has the WM_CLASS hint specified. Otherwise the first window having this
class hint is mapped and raised. Syntax:
....
runonce "title" icon_name "res_name.res_class" program_executable options
runonce "title" icon_name "res_name" program_executable options
runonce "title" icon_name ".res_class" program_executable options
....
The class hint of an application window can be figured out by running
....
$ xprop WM_CLASS
....

Submenus can be added using the same keywords as the `menu` configuration file.

Only double quotes are interpreted by IceWM. IceWM doesn't run the shell
automatically, so you may have to do that.

== Hot Keys

IceWM allows launching of arbitrary programs with any key combination. This is
configured in the `keys` file.  The syntax of this file is like:

*key* "key combination" program options...

For example:
....
key  "Alt+Ctrl+t"  xterm -rv
key "Ctrl+Shift+r" icewm --restart
runonce "Alt+F12"  "res_name.res_class" program_executable options
....

== Window Options (updated 2018-03-04)

The *winoptions* file is used to configure settings
for individual application windows.
Each line in this file must have one of the following formats:

* window_name.window_class.option: argument
* window_name.window_role.option: argument
* window_class.option: argument
* window_name.option: argument
* window_role.option: argument
* .option: argument

The last format sets a default option value for all windows.
Each window on the desktop should have *name* and *class*
resources associated with it.
Some applications also have a *window role* resource.
They can be determined using the `xprop` utility.
When used on a toplevel window,
`xprop | grep -e CLASS -e ROLE`
should output a line like this:
....
WM_CLASS = "name", "Class"
....
and may also display a line like this:
....
WM_WINDOW_ROLE = "window role"
....

It's possible that an application's *name* and/or *class*
contains a dot character (*.*), which is also used
by IceWM to separate *name*, *class* and *role* values.
In this case precede the dot with the backslash character.
In the following example, we suppose an application's
window has `the.name` as its *name* value
and `The.Class` as its *class* value and for this
combination we set *option* to *argument*.

....
the\.name.The\.Class.option: argument
....

Options that can be set per window are as follows:

+icon+:: The name of the icon.
+workspace+:: Default workspace for window (number, counting from 0)
+layer+:: The default stacking layer for the window.
Layer can be one of the following seven strings:
;;
_Desktop_::: Desktop window. There should be only one window in this layer.
_Below_::: Below default layer.
_Normal_::: Default layer for the windows.
_OnTop_::: Above the default.
_Dock_::: Layer for windows docked to the edge of the screen.
_AboveDock_::: Layer for the windows above the dock.
_Menu_::: Layer for the windows above the dock.
;; You can also use a number from 0 to 15.

+geometry+::
The default geometry for the window. This geometry should be
specified in the usual X11-geometry-syntax, formal notation:
....
    [=][<width>{xX}<height>][{+-}<xoffset>{+-}<yoffset>]
....

+tray+::
The default tray option for the window.
This affects both the tray and the task pane.
Tray can be one of the following strings:
;;
_Ignore_::: Don't add an icon to the tray pane.
_Minimized_::: Add an icon the the tray. Remove the task pane button when minimized.
_Exclusive_::: Add an icon the the tray. Never create a task pane button.

+order: 0+:: The sorting order of task buttons and tray icons.
The default value is zero. Increasing positive values go farther right,
while decreasing negative values go farther left.
The order option applies to the task pane, the tray pane and the system tray.
+allWorkspaces: 0+:: If set to 1, window will be visible on all workspaces.
+appTakesFocus: 0+:: if set to 1, IceWM will assume the window supports the WM_TAKE_FOCUS protocol even if the window did not advertise that it does.
+dBorder: 1+:: If set to 0, window will not have a border.
+dClose: 1+:: If set to 0, window will not have a close button.
+dMaximize: 1+:: If set to 0, window will not have a maximize button.
+dMinimize: 1+:: If set to 0, window will not have a minimize button.
+dResize: 1+:: If set to 0, window will not have a resize border.
+dSysMenu: 1+:: If set to 0, window will not have a system menu.
+dTitleBar: 1+:: If set to 0, window will not have a title bar.
+doNotCover: 0+:: if set to 1, this window will limit the workspace available for regular applications. At the moment the window has to be sticky to make it work.
+doNotFocus: 0+:: if set to 1, IceWM will never give focus to the window.
+fClose: 1+:: If set to 0, window will not be closable.
+fHide: 1+:: If set to 0, window will not be hidable.
+fMaximize: 1+:: If set to 0, window will not be maximizable.
+fMinimize: 1+:: If set to 0, window will not be minimizable.
+fMove: 1+:: If set to 0, window will not be movable.

== Icon handling

=== Generic

The window manager expects to find two XPM files for each icon
specified in the configuration files as _ICON_. They should be named like
this:

+ICON_16x16.xpm+:: A small 16x16 pixmap.
+ICON_32x32.xpm+:: A normal 32x32 pixmap.
+ICON_48x48.xpm+:: A large 48x48 pixmap.

Other pixmap sizes like 20x20, 24x24, 40x40, 48x48, 64x64 might be used
in the future. Perhaps we need a file format that can contain
more than one image (with different sizes and color depths) like
Windows'95 and OS/2 .ICO files.

It would be nice to have a feature from OS/2 that varies the icon size
with screen resolution (16x16 and 32x32 icons are quite small on 4000x4000
screens ;-)

=== GDK-Pixbuf

When icewm was configured with the `--enable-gdk-pixbuf` option
all of GdkPixbuf's image formats are supported.
Use them by specifying the full filename or an absolute path:

+ICON.bmp+:: A PPM icon in your IconPath.
+/usr/share/pixmap/ICON.png+:: An PNG image with absolute location.

== Mouse cursors

IceWM scans the theme and configuration directories for a subdirectory called
_cursors_ containing monochrome but transparent XPM files. To change the
mouse cursor you have to use this filenames:

+left.xbm+:: Default cursor (usually pointer to the left).
+right.xbm+:: Menu cursor (usually pointer to the right).
+move.xbm+:: Window movement cursor.
+sizeTL.xbm+:: Cursor when you resize the window by top left.
+sizeT.xbm+:: Cursor when you resize the window by top.
+sizeTR.xbm+:: Cursor when you resize the window by top right.
+sizeL.xbm+:: Cursor when you resize the window by left.
+sizeR.xbm+:: Cursor when you resize the window by right.
+sizeBL.xbm+:: Cursor when you resize the window by bottom left.
+sizeB.xbm+:: Cursor when you resize the window by bottom.
+sizeBR.xbm+:: Cursor when you resize the window by bottom right.

== Themes

Themes are used to configure the way the window manager looks. Things
like fonts, colors, border sizes, button pixmaps can be
configured. Put together they form a theme.

Theme files are searched in the `themes`
subdirectories.

These directories contain other directories that contain related theme files and
their .xpm files. Each theme file specifies fonts, colors, border sizes, ...

The theme to use is specified in `~/.icewm/theme` file:

+Theme = "nice/default.theme"+::
Name of the theme to use. Both the directory
and theme file name must be specified.

If the theme directory contains a file named _fonts.dir_ created by
mkfontdir the theme directory is inserted into the X servers font search path.

https://www.box-look.org/browse/cat/142/ord/latest/[www.box-look.org]
has a very large number of themes which were created by users of IceWM.

== Command Line Options

`icewm` supports the following options:

+-d, --display=NAME+::  NAME of the X server to use.
+--client-id=ID+::      Client id to use when contacting session manager.
+--sync+::              Synchronize X11 commands.
+-c, --config=FILE+::   Load preferences from FILE.
+-t, --theme=FILE+::    Load theme from FILE.
+--postpreferences+::   Print preferences after all processing.
+-V, --version+::       Prints version information and exits.
+-h, --help+::          Prints this usage screen and exits.
+--replace+::           Replace an existing window manager.
+-r, --restart+::       Tell the running icewm to restart itself.
+--configured+::        Print the compile time configuration.
+--directories+::       Print the configuration directories.
+-l, --list-themes+::   Print a list of all available themes.

The restart option can be used to reload the IceWM configuration
after modifications. It is the preferred way to restart IceWM
from the command line or in scripts.
To load a different theme from the command line,
combine this with the `--theme=NAME` option like:

    icewm -r -t CrystalBlue

The theme name will then be saved to the 'theme'
configuration file, before restarting IceWM.
