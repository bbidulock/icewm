This document is the documentation for the IceWM X11 window manager.

This document is incomplete. Almost everything is subject to change.

<toc>

<sect>Introduction<p>

The goal of <bf/IceWM/ is to provide a small, fast and familiar window
manager for the X11 window system. Compatibility with the
<tt/mwm/ window manager is desired and will be implemented where
appropriate.

<bf/IceWM/ originally was designed to emulate the look of Motif, OS/2 Warp
4, OS/2 Warp 3 and Windows 95. Since it has a theming engine (hint:
<url url="http://www.icewm.org/"/) others styles are possible.

It also tries to combine the feel of the above systems whenever it
is compatible.

Generally, it tries to make all functions available both by keyboard
and by mouse (this is not currently possible when using mouse focus).

Extreme configurability similar to <tt/fvwm/ and many other window
managers is <bf/NOT/ the goal.

Further information can be found at <url url="http://icewm.themes.org/"/.

<sect>Starting icewm<p>

<tt/icewm/ executable must be on $PATH for restart function to work
correctly.

First make sure that there is no $HOME/.xinitrc or $HOME/.Xsession file
or that any of those correctly starts $HOME/.Xclients.

The recommended way to start is from $HOME/.Xclients shell script (must be
executable). Mine looks something like this:

<verb>
# run profile to set $PATH and other env vars correctly
. $HOME/.bash_profile
# setup background
xsetroot -solid '#056'
# setup mouse acceleration
xset m 7 2
# run initial programs
xterm &amp;
# start icewm, and run xterm if it crashes (just to be safe)
exec icewm || exec xterm -fg red
</verb>

The xterm on the last line is there simply to make sure that your X
session doesn't crash if icewm does (should never happen). You can
restart icewm from there or start some other window manager. The
session will close if you close the xterm.

The above should work for most Linux systems. On commercial unices you
should use $HOME/.dtprofile if you have CDE or $HOME/.vueprofile for
HP-UX with HP VUE. If you are running xdm or some other login program
check it's manpage for the correct place to start the window manager
(usually ~/.Xsession).

<sect>Focus models<p>

<bf/IceWM/ implements four general focus models:

<descrip>
<tag/clickToRaise/ Exactly like Win95, OS/2 Warp. When window
is clicked with a mouse, it is raised and activated.

<tag/clickToFocus/ Window is raised and focused when titlebar or frame
border is clicked. Window is focused but not raised when window interior
is clicked.

<tag/pointerFocus/
When the mouse is moved, focus is set to window
under a mouse. It should be possible to change focus with the
keyboard when mouse is not moved.

<tag/explicitFocus/
When a window is clicked, it is activated, but not raised.
New windows do not automatically get the focus unless they
are transient windows for the active window.


<em/I am experimenting with this, to develop something more flexible
then clickFocus./
</descrip>

Detailed configuration is possible using the configuration file options.

<sect>Mouse Commands<p>

<sect1>Frame Commands<p>

<sect>Configuration/Resource/Library Path<p><label id="lib">

Many files in icewm are searched in library path. The path contains the following
directories:<p>
<descrip>
<tag>$HOME/.icewm</tag> user's personal customization
<tag>/etc/X11/icewm</tag> system-wide customized defaults
<tag>/usr/local/lib/X11/icewm</tag> compiled-in default directory with default files
(for .rpm packages the default is /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/icewm)
</descrip>

The directories are searched in the above order, so any file located
in the system/install directory can be overridden by the user by creating
the same directory hierarchy under <tt>$HOME/.icewm</tt>.

<sect>Configuration Files<p>

<bf/IceWM/ uses the following configuration files:
<itemize>
<item><tt><ref id="lib">/<ref id="preferences"></tt> - General settings - paths,
colors, fonts...
<item><tt><ref id="lib">/<ref id="menu"></tt> - Menu of startable applications. Usually customized
by the user.
<item><tt><ref id="lib">/<ref id="programs"></tt> - Automatically generated menu of startable
applications (this should be used for <bf/wmconfig/, <bf/menu/ or similar packages, perhaps
as a part of the login or X startup sequence).
<item><tt><ref id="lib">/<ref id="winoptions"></tt> - Application window options
</itemize>

</descrip>

<sect>Menus and Toolbar<p>

<sect1>menu<label id="menu"><p>

User menu configuration file. Configures programs in root/start menu.

<sect1>toolbar<label id="toolbar"><p>

Toolbar configuration file. Configures programs available as buttons on the taskbar.

<sect1>programs<label id="programs"><p>

Usually automatically generated menu configuration file of installed programs. The
<tt/programs/ file should be automatically generated by <tt/wmconfig/ (Redhat),
<tt/menu/ (Debian) or an equivalent program (kde2ice and gno2ice to convert
GNOME/KDE Menu hierarchy are available).

<p>
Programs can be added using the following syntax:<p>
<verb>
prog "title" icon_name program_executable options
</verb>

icon_name can be <tt/-/ if icon is not wanted.
<p>
The "runonce" keyword allows to launch an application only when no window
has the WM_CLASS hint specified. Otherwise the first window having this
class hint is mapped and raised. Syntax:<p>
<verb>
runonce "res_name.res_class" "title" icon_name program_executable options
runonce "res_name" "title" icon_name program_executable options
runonce ".res_class" "title" icon_name program_executable options
</verb>
The class hint can be figured out by running
<verb>
$ xprop | grep WM_CLASS
</verb>
<p>
Submenus can be added using the following syntax:<p>
<verb>
menu "title" icon_name {
# contained items
}
</verb>

Only double quotes are interpreted by icewm. Icewm doesn't run the shell
automatically, so you may have to do that.

<sect>Keys<p>

Icewm allows launching of arbitrary programs with any key combination. This is
configured in the <tt><ref id="lib" name="libpath">/<bf/keys/</tt> file.

Syntax of the file is like this:
<p>
<bf/key/ "key combination" program options...
<p>
For example:
<verb>
key "Alt+Ctrl+t" xterm
</verb>

<sect>Window Options<label id="winoptions"><p>

<bf/winoptions/ file is used to configure settings for individual application windows.

Each line in the file must be in one of the possible formats:

window_class.window_name.option: argument
window_name.option: argument
window_class.option: argument

Each window on the desktop has (should) <bf/class/ and <bf/name/ resources associated with it.
They can be determined using the <tt/xprop/ utility.

xprop should display a line like this when used on a toplevel window:
<verb>
WM_CLASS = "name", "class"
</verb>

Options that can be set per window are as follows:

<descrip>
<tag/icon/ The name of the icon.
<tag/workspace/ Default workspace for window (number, counting from 0)
<tag/layer/ Default layer for the window. Layer can be one of the following strings:

<descrip>
<tag/Desktop/ Desktop window. There should be only one window in this layer.
<tag/Below/ Below default layer.
<tag/Normal/ Default layer for the windows.
<tag/OnTop/ Above the default.
<tag/Dock/ Layer for windows docked to the edge of the screen.
<tag/AboveDock/ Layer for the windows above the dock.
<tag/Menu/ Layer for the windows above the dock.
</descrip>

You can also use the numbers from <tt/WinMgr.h/.

<tag/tray/ Default tray option for the window. Affects both the tray and the
task pane. Tray can be one of the following strings:

<descrip>
<tag/Ignore/ Don't add an icon to the tray pane.
<tag/Minimized/ Add an icon the the tray. Remove the task pane button when minimized.
<tag/Exclusive/ Add an icon the the tray. Never create a task pane button .
</descrip>

<tag/allWorkspaces=0/ If set to 1, window will be visible on all workspaces.
<tag/ignoreWinList=0/ If set to 1, window will not appear in the window list.
<tag/ignoreTaskBar=0/ If set to 1, window will not appear on the task bar.
<tag/ignoreQuickSwitch=0/ If set to 1, window will not be accessible using QuickSwitch feature (Alt+Tab).
<tag/fullKeys=0/ If set to 1, the window manager leave more keys (Alt+F?) to the application.
<tag/fMove=1/ If set to 0, window will not be movable.
<tag/fResize=1/ If set to 0, window will not be resizable.
<tag/fClose=1/ If set to 0, window will not be closable.
<tag/fMinimize=1/ If set to 0, window will not be minimizable.
<tag/fMaximize=1/ If set to 0, window will not be maximizable.
<tag/fHide=1/ If set to 0, window will not be hidable.
<tag/fRollup=1/ If set to 0, window will not be shadable.
<tag/dTitleBar=1/ If set to 0, window will not have a title bar.

<tag/dBorder=1/ If set to 0, window will not have a border.
<tag/dResize=1/ If set to 0, window will not have a resize border.
<tag/dClose=1/ If set to 0, window will not have a close button.
<tag/dMinimize=1/ If set to 0, window will not have a minimize button.
<tag/dMaximize=1/ If set to 0, window will not have a maximize button.
<tag/noFocusOnAppRaise/ if set to 1, window will not automatically get focus as
application raises it.
<tag/ignoreNoFocusHint/ if set to 1, icewm will focus even if the window does not
handle input.
<tag/doNotCover=0/ if set to 1, this window will limit the workspace available for
regular applications. window has to be sticky at the moment to make it work

</descrip>

<sect>Icon handling<p>

<sect1>Generic<p>

The window manager expects to find two XPM files for each icon
specified in the configuration files as <em/ICON/. They should be named like
this:
<descrip>
<tag><em/ICON/<tt/_16x16.xpm/</tag> A small 16x16 pixmap.
<tag><em/ICON/<tt/_32x32.xpm/</tag> A normal 32x32 pixmap.
<tag><em/ICON/<tt/_48x48.xpm/</tag> A large 48x48 pixmap.
</descrip>

Other pixmap sizes like 20x20, 24x24, 40x40, 48x48, 64x64 might be used
in the future. Perhaps we need a file format that can contain
more than one image (with different sizes and color depths) like
Windows'95 and OS/2 .ICO files.

It would be nice to have a feature from OS/2 that varies the icon size
with screen resolution (16x16 and 32x32 icons are quite small on 4000x4000
screens ;-)

<sect1>Imlib<p>
When compiled with Imlib image library all of Imlib's image formats 
(bmp, jpeg, ppm, tiff, gif, png, ps, xpm on my machine) are supported. 
Use them by specifying the full filename or an absolute path:
<descrip>
<tag><em/ICON.bmp,/</tag>A PPM icon in your IconPath.
<tag><em>/usr/share/pixmap/ICON.png</em></tag> An PNG image with absolute location.
</descrip>

<sect>Mouse cursors<p>

IceWM scans the theme and configuration directories for a subdirectory called
<em/cursors/ containing monochrome but transparent XPM files. To change the
mouse cursor you have to use this filenames:

<descrip>
<tag><em/left.xbm/</tag>Default cursor (usually pointer to the left).
<tag><em/right.xbm/</tag>Menu cursor (usually pointer to the right).
<tag><em/move.xbm/</tag>Window movement cursor.
<tag><em/sizeTL.xbm/</tag>Cursor when you resize the window by top left.
<tag><em/sizeT.xbm/</tag>Cursor when you resize the window by top.
<tag><em/sizeTR.xbm/</tag>Cursor when you resize the window by top right.
<tag><em/sizeL.xbm/</tag>Cursor when you resize the window by left.
<tag><em/sizeR.xbm/</tag>Cursor when you resize the window by right.
<tag><em/sizeBL.xbm/</tag>Cursor when you resize the window by bottom left.
<tag><em/sizeB.xbm/</tag>Cursor when you resize the window by bottom.
<tag><em/sizeBR.xbm/</tag>Cursor when you resize the window by bottom right.
</descrip>

<sect>Themes<p>

Themes are used to configure the way how the window manager looks. Things
like fonts, colors, border sizes, button pixmaps can be configured. Together
these things form a theme.

Theme files are searched in the <tt><ref id="lib" name="libpath">/themes</tt>
subdirectories.

These directories contain other directories that contain related theme files and
their .xpm files. Each theme file specifies fonts, colors, border sizes, ...

The theme to use is specified using <tt/Theme/ configuration option or
<tt/-t/ command line options in the preferences file.

<descrip>
<tag>Theme = "nice/default.theme"</tag> Name of the theme to use. Both the directory
and theme file name must be specified.
</descrip>

If the theme directory contains a file named <em/fonts.dir/ created my 
mkfontdir the theme directory is inserted into the X servers font search
path.

<url url="http://icewm.themes.org/"/ contains various nice themes created
by users of IceWM.

<sect>Command Line Options<p>

<descrip>
<tag/-display DISPLAY/ Set X display to <bf/DISPLAY/.
<tag/-c CONFIG/ Use configuration file <bf/CONFIG/.
<tag/-v/ Display version.
<tag/-n/ Don't use a configuration file. Uses builtin defaults only.
<tag/-t theme/ Use the specified theme.
<tag/-debug/ Dump various debug information to stderr.
</descrip>
