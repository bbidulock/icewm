Ice Window Manager (IceWM)
==========================

This is a fork of the IceWM CVS on [sourceforge][13].  It includes all changes
from the `icewm-1-3-BRANCH` branch, greatly enhanced EWMH/ICCCM compliance, as
well as patches collected from Arch Linux, Debian, pld-linux, the IceWM bug
list, and various other GitHub forks.

> The name was decided on a very hot day... (and Marko started writing it in
> winter ;-)  The aim of IceWM is to have good 'Feel' and decent 'Look'. 'Feel'
> is much more important than 'Look' ...


Release
-------

This is the `@PACKAGE@-@VERSION@` package, released @DATE@.  This release, and
the latest version, can be obtained from [GitHub][1], using a command such as:

    $> git clone https://github.com/bbidulock/@PACKAGE@.git

Please see the [NEWS][3] file for release notes and history of user visible
changes for the current version, and the [ChangeLog][4] file for a more
detailed history of implementation changes.  The [TODO][5] file lists features
not yet implemented and other outstanding items.

Please see the [INSTALL][7] file for installation instructions.

When working from `git(1)`, please use this file.  An abbreviated
installation procedure that works for most applications appears below.

This release is published under LGPL.  Please see the license
in the file [COPYING][9].


Quick Start
-----------

The quickest and easiest way to get @PACKAGE@ up and running is to run the
following commands:

    $> git clone https://github.com/bbidulock/@PACKAGE@.git
    $> cd @PACKAGE@
    $> ./autogen.sh
    $> ./configure \
       --enable-shaped-decorations --enable-gradients \
       --enable-guievents --with-icesound=ALSA,OSS \
       --disable-menus-gnome2 --enable-silent-rules
    $> make
    $> make DESTDIR="$pkgdir" install

This will configure, compile and install @PACKAGE@ the quickest.  For those who
like to spend the extra 15 seconds reading `./configure --help`, some compile
time options can be turned on and off before the build.

For general information on GNU's `./configure`, see the file [INSTALL][7].

Please see the [INSTALL][7] file for more detailed installation instructions.
An alternative way to build IceWM using CMake is [documented here][20].
The [ChangeLog][4] file contains a detailed history of implementation changes.
The [COMPLIANCE][6] file lists the current state of EWMH/ICCCM compliance.  The
[NEWS][3] file has release notes and history of user visible changes of the
current version.  The [TODO][5] file lists features not yet implemented and
other outstanding items.

This release is published under LGPL license that can be found in the file
[COPYING][9].

Prerequisites
-------------

Building from tarball requires:

 - gcc or clang (_for compiling_)
 - libxft (_for font rendering_)
 - libxinerama (_for XINERAMA support_)
 - gdk-pixbuf2 (_for pixmap rendering_)
 - libxrandr (_for XRANDR support_)
 - libsndfile (_for sound support_)
 - libsm (_for X11R6 session management_)
 - fribidi (_for i18n text rendering_)

Building from git also requires:

 - git (_for cloning the git repository and updating changelogs_)
 - autoconf/automake or cmake toolchain (_for build scripts_)
 - xorg-mkfontdir (_for installing themes_)
 - asciidoctor or asciidoc (_for creating html documentation_)
 - markdown (_for building release package_)


Configuring IceWM
-----------------

Documentation for configuring the window manager can be obtained from [IceWM
Website][14] or from the [online manual][16].

Unfortunately the documentation is for version 1.2.27 and is incomplete
at that; however, it is for the most part usable.
The good news is that the
[__icewm__(1)][27], [__icewmbg__(1)][23] and [__icesound__(1)][22]
manual pages for version @VERSION@ are complete and fully up-to-date.


Included Utilities
------------------

Currently, the only included utilities are:

 - [__icewmbg__(1)][23] (_a background setting program_),
 - [__icewmtray__(1)][30] (_a system tray for the IceWM taskbar_), and,
 - [__icewm-session__(1)][28] (_a program to launch the window manager, icewmbg and
   icewmtray in an orderly fashion_),
 - [__icewm-menu-fdo__(1)][25] (_a utility to genenerate XDG menus_),
 - [__icewm-menu-gnome2__(1)][26] (_a utility to generate GNOME menus_),
 - [__icewmhint__(1)][24] (_a utility to set IceWM-specific window options hint_).
 - [__icesound__(1)][22] (_play audio files when interesting GUI events happen_).


Third-party Utilities
---------------------

Unspecified keyboard shortcuts can be handled with the __bbkeys__(1) utility
available from [sourceforge][17].  For additional utilities see the [IceWM
FAQ][15].


wm-session
----------

`/proc/wm-session` is used to register the process id of an application able to
free resources smoothly when the kernel decides that memory resource have
reached a critical limit. The registered application is notified of this
situation by the signal `SIGUSR1`.

On full featured desktop machines it would make sense to use the session
manager for this purpose. On X window PDAs which have limited memory resources
it makes sense to let the window manager send `WM_DELETE_WINDOW` message to the
last recently used application.


__Requirements to use this feature in IceWM:__

  - A patched kernel, a patch for Linux 2.4.3 is available in the contrib
    file module.

  - A patched X server assigning the clients process id to each newly
    mapped window. Alternatively you can preload the preice library
    available in the contrib file module.

  - `$ export LD_PRELOAD=$PATH_TO/libpreice.so`

  - IceWM configured to have wm-session support
    (./configure --enable-wm-session ...)

The contrib file module of IceWM is located on [sourceforge][12].

> Chester Kuo <chester@linux.org.tw> and
> Mathias Hasselman <mathias.hasselman@gmx.de>.


Bug Reports
-----------

Issues can be reported on [GitHub][2].  Please try to submit short patches or
pull requests if you can.  If you would like to perform regular maintenance
activities (e.g. if you are a maintainer of an IceWM package for a
distribution), contact me for push access.

I normally like to have the issuers of problem reports close the report once
it has been resolved.  I do not want you to think that we are being dismissive,
because I welcome all reports.

Bug reports, feedback, and suggestions pertaining to the original CVS version
can be sent to: Marko.Macek@gmx.net or icewm-user@lists.sourceforge.net

See also [BUGS][8], [TODO][5] and the sites at:

  - http://www.icewm.org/
  - http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/icewm/
  - http://icewm.sourceforge.net/


Development
-----------

If you would like to develop against this fork, the easiest way is to obtain a
[GitHub account][10], fork the [repository][1] and perform your development.
Send me a pull request when you have something stable.  If you submit regular
pull requests that get accepted, I will just give to push access to save time.


Translations
------------

You can provide translations by patching `.po` files and issuing pull requests,
or you can use the [openSUSE weblate tool][11].  There are two XDG files,
[icewm.desktop][18] and [icewm-session.desktop][19] than may need manual
translations.  If you have difficulties using the tools, just send me the updated
`.po` file or a patch to apply.
