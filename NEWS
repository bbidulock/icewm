      update NEWS file
      icewm-1-4-BRANCH is now the default
      partially address issue #146
      better fix for issue #146
      final tweak for #146
      Merge branch 'icewm-1-4-BRANCH' of github.com:bbidulock/icewm into
        icewm-1-4-BRANCH

Bert Gijsbers <gijsbers@science.uva.nl> (5):
      Omit -b in git checkout icewm-1-4-BRANCH.
      Specify output with -o icewm.html.
      Update ChangeLog to 1.4.1 and remove all changes for the 1.3.12 release
        and older.
      New function copyPixmaps adds more defaults for missing pixmaps. When some
        pixmaps are missing then they are copied from others. This restores
        backward compatibility in issue #144.
      Always show icon in the top left corner of a window in issue #144.

Brian Bidulock <bidulock@openss7.com> (1):
      Merge pull request #150 from
        Code7R/feature/increase_theme_menu_collapsing_threshold

Eduard Bloch <blade@debian.org> (1):
      Increased the trigger value for the theme menu nesting algorithm


Release icewm-1.4.1 released 2017-07-28
---------------------------------------

git shortlog -e -n -w80,6,8 1.4.0...1.4.1

Bert Gijsbers <gijsbers@science.uva.nl> (5):
      Before calling setNetFrameExtents check if client() is non-null. This
        prevents a SEGV crash which occasionally occurs when closing all
        windows.
      Only load a gradient when it is specified in the theme "gradients" option.
        This fixes issue #144.
      Omit -b in git checkout icewm-1-4-BRANCH.
      Update to version 1.4.0.
      Prepare for 1.4.1 release.

Release icewm-1.4.0 released 2017-07-24
---------------------------------------

git shortlog -e -n -w80,6,8 1.3.12...1.4.0

Bert Gijsbers <gijsbers@science.uva.nl> (161):
      Fix for 'msgstr' not being a valid C format string, unlike 'msgid'.
      Fix for /proc/stat not being opened with FD_CLOEXEC flag. This would cause
        IceWM to generate warnings whenever it fork+execs a child program.
      Fix for properly closing open fd on error.
      Fix for properly closing open fd on error.
      Fix for not leaving stdin closed.
      Fix for properly closing dup-ed socket.
      Fix for properly closing open fd on error.
      Fix for properly dup2/close devnull.
      Fix for preventing lots of spurious warning messages for MappingNotify
        events.
      Fix to replace msg with MSG to keep IceWM silent when not debugging.
      Two strstr calls for "AC" and "BAT" had the parameters reversed: fixed.
        strcat3 could be changed from 12 lines to 1: fixed.
      Reading of /proc and /sys files simplified and made more robust.
        Previously the frequency of only one CPU core was examined. Now all
        frequencies of the first 8 CPU cores are examined. In the CPU tooltip
        give the maximum and minimum CPU core frequency. Also give the
        temperatures with one decimal. Fix temperature formatting bug for C.
      Merge branch 'icewm-1-3-BRANCH' into tooltip-details
      Implement the top of the TODO list: add support for --help and --version
        options to each executable.
      remove obsolete pragmas (interface + implementation).
      small changes to make BUILD_TESTS work (except for icebar)
      precondition simplification
      tTempBuf is not needed and not desirable
      precondition simplification
      mstring cleanup to make it more readable and more easily verifiable
        correct.
      much more elaborate test suite for mstring.
      bug fix for missing sizeof(data_t) in YString::set(...)
      Assignment operators should return a reference, not a copy.  Prevent
        calling data() when length() is zero as this may access a NULL fStr
        causing a crash.
      Make mstring::split use indexOf, which is shorter and more correct (avoids
        dereferencing null strings).
      Icehelp didn't draw the html list entries. Fixed processing of node::li
        nodes by calling draw() to draw <LI> entries. There were several
        mismatches of new/delete/malloc/free: fixed. Freed memory was accessed
        in handleClose(): fixed. In YIcon::findIcon(int)  newstr was called for
        a temporary string which was never going to be freed anywhere: fixed by
        using pstring instead of newstr.
      Leak fix: objects should be a YObjectArray otherwise clear() will not be
        called.
      Leak fix in findThemes: npath was used where dpath was meant. configArg
        wasn't used.
      Leak fix in YWMApp::actionPerformed and in meain.
      leak fix in WindowOptions::setWinOption for op->icon.
      No slash needed when terminating an 'url' tag (3x).
      upath::parent and upath::name were not implemented. upath::slash prevents
        temporaries. cstring::operator const char *() simplifies code. Several
        fixes to relative()/child(). A few minor new methods and operators.
        +upath tests.
      no need for misc.$(OBJEXT) when libice.la is already given.
      Goodbye SGML here is AsciiDoc. The doc/*.sgml files replaced by
        doc/icewm.adoc. Autoconf and cmake updated.
      rename with .md extension
      markdownify
      renamed to INSTALL-cmakebuild.md
      update for cmakebuild and asciidoc.
      parse the AsciiDoc output.
      remove the problematic dependency on glob_pattern_p by writing our own
        internal version.
      remove non-portable dependency on asprintf.
      Remove non-portable dependency on asprintf.  Remove stray backslashes.
        Rewrite while loops as for loops.  Replace calloc+strcpy with strdup.
      Remove HAVE_ASPRINTF from YInputLine::complete as globit_best no longer
        uses asprintf.
      Prevent warnings when compiling with: make CXX="g++ -std=c++98 -pedantic
        -Wall".
      +strlcpy, strlcat, read_file, read_fd, tlog.
      mstring + upath improvements.
      Properly handle keyboard events by scrollbars.
      Make icehelp feature complete.
      add TOC, link to X startup. Remove LibPath (no longer used).
      remove duplicate references to sources which are also in
        ${ICE_COMMON_SRCS}.
      HAVE_ASPRINTF doesn't imply _GNU_SOURCE. Remove both.
      Make globit.c 7-bit ASCII.
      include config.h (needed for CMake).
      add load_text_file, check for EINTR when reading, use O_TEXT in read_file.
      Cleanup option parsing: be more strict in what is accepted as option
        value, don't abort parsing on error, but skip the offending line and
        continue parsing the next option. Remove appendStr (to reduce memory
        allocations), simplify code. Improve linkage: move all yconfig.cc
        external code in class YConfig.
      POSIX-compliancy requires the use of __linux__, instead of linux. linux
        may not be defined even though __linux__ is. For instance with g++
        -std=c++98.
      +4 convenience methods.
      Stricter parsing of winoptions. One of two loadMenus made obsolete.
        Rewrote loadMenusProg.
      stricter parsing of whitespace in winoptions. Fix a delete[]. Fix a leak
        for icon. Simplify loadWinOptions.
      Use upath for configuration directories, prevents a leak and simplifies
        code (no manual memory management).
      A redesign with cleaner semantics and 3 subclasses for different release
        of dynamic memory.
      When parsing "env" for each line add all expansion results. Trim every
        "env" string. Permit "env" input lines where '=' is surrounded with
        spaces.
      test strlcpy with operlap of source/destination.
      +stat method.
      Simplify closeFiles and drastically reduce number of fcntl system calls on
        exec. If execlp fails then print a warning with exe + strerror.
      add 2 missing destructors.
      prefer setenv over putenv.
      Fix for focus on map: only compare fUserTime when it is unequal to -1,
        otherwise doActivate would always be set to false.
      Fix for focus on map: only compare fUserTime when it is unequal to -1,
        otherwise doActivate would always be set to false.
      merge wmframe.cc fix
      Add --display option to icewm-session.  Save errno in fail().
      bool configurationNeeded was never needed, now deleted.
      Improve error handling in loadMenusProg. Allow waitpid to fail because of
        a competing SIGCHILD handler.
      Don't assume execl /bin/sh can never fail in
        YWindowManager::execAfterFork.
      Fix int format string errors for calls to warn(...) for long arguments.
      Consistently use ACOUNT where appropriate.
      Restore support for const copy operations using an ownership flag.
        Improve efficiency by avoiding virtual tables. Prevent inadvertent
        exchange of pointers between different allocation mechanisms
        (free/delete/[]). Tested OK sofar.
      Consistently use ACOUNT where appropriate.
      print_preferences print_options
      Add 3 options to icewm: "  --configured        Print the compile time
        configuration.
" "  --directories       Print the configuration
        directories.
" "  --postpreferences   Print preferences after all
        processing.
"
      Silence annoying startup messages about using private configuration files.
      Update, small changes.
      If left hand side of upath.relative() is empty then return right hand side
        unmodified.
      Prefer static linkage.
      More accurate countThemes. Old version always subtracted 1, even if
        directory was non-existent or empty. New version verifies if de->d_name
        is a directory and if it has a readable "default.theme" file in it.
      correction: access == 0 means yes it exists.
      Support menuButton pixmaps in motif. This fixes
        https://github.com/bbidulock/icewm/issues/31
      udir.h provides a small but handy class for simplifying code which deals
        with directories, like themes.
      Simplify code for directories, like themes, with udir class.
      Merge.
      Correction: run "icewmtray" before "startup" script.
      Move help text into separate method getHelpText().
      Properly support searching for resources in XDG_CONFIG_HOME. First search
        in XDG_CONFIG_HOME, only then in other directories. Simplifications and
        optimizations to YResourcePaths. YPathElement could be removed as it is
        just a upath. When removing elements in a loop then count downwards to
        zero to avoid quadratic time.
      Support referring to a theme without the last component (basename
        "default.theme"). This requires less typing. Optimization to getArgument
        to prevents lots of memory allocations when parsing preferences.
      Fix for getExtension (wasn't used anywhere sofar).
      Support the usual icewm command line options in icewm-session and
        propagate their values to child programs when fork+execing. Also support
        them in icewmtray and icewmbg. The -t option to icewm didn't work
        properly because it used GetLongArgument instead of GetShortArgument:
        fixed. Don't scan preferences for a themeName when themeName has already
        been given on the command line. Allow to override preferences with some
        other config file. Cleanup of unused code in icewmbg.cc. Memory leak fix
        in themes.cc when 15+ themes are available and many submenus are created
        with a strdup which was never freed. Remove the --no-configure
        commandline option as it wasn't implemented.
      Update options.
      --list-themes       Print a list of all available themes.
      Remove superfluous #include statements.
      Print directories in the order IceWM searches in them.
      More man page new content.
      Add GCC __attribute__ for format string checks. Define it empty for
        non-gcc.
      Cleanup code a bit for icetray.cc.
      Remove superfluous #include statements.
      Prefer snprintf/strlcpy/strlcat over sprintf/strcpy/strcat in some cases.
      splitall may return true and an empty string. Detect this and continue.
      YIcon would test a large number of paths, some of which have no chance for
        success.  Reduce the number of such tests. Also reduce duplicate path
        tests. Fully support the .SVG image format when searching for icons.
      +SVG and icon sizes.
      Add remove and renameAs. Add defaults to access and mkdir.
      For --list-themes also allow short -l alias.
      Always set line buffering mode for stdout.
      Make sure all YIcon resources are freed on termination.
      Because we have only Focus and Themes it doesn't make sens to create a
        whole new Settings submenu in the toplevel menu. Instead of "Settings"
        just use entries for Focus + Themes.
      Move functions of wmconfig.cc into class WMConfig (except for addWork and
        setLook). Rewrite setDefault: properly support XDG config directory, use
        at most one hash comment sign per config line, be very careful about
        existence of directories and simplify file I/O code.
      Also report the name of the theme in warnings about gradients.
      ycmdline.[ch] is not used in gnome1 and gnome2: removed.
      Sort the entries in browsing menus alphabetically.
      Remove superfluous #include statements.
      Check if no config directory exists and could not be made.
      Class Argument supports efficient storage of configuration parsing.
      Use class Argument to efficiently store parsing results. This also prevent
        memory leaks in the context of parsing errors when character arrays were
        not deleted before return from parseMenus().
      Better support theme names which don't have a slash or a .theme
        extensions.
      getResourcePaths was called with a null argument instead of "workspace".
        This results in many more file lookups. Use "workspace" when calling
        getResourcePaths for a small speedup.
      Complete redesign which avoids virtual or refcounts, but supports
        inter-allocation type assingment (free/new/new[]).
      For every cursor pointer one new call to getResourcePaths would be done,
        which is inefficient. Only do it once or twice per startup for a small
        speedup.
      Make some methods static and private.
      update URLs.
      Add 4 new themes: CrystalBlue, Helix, NanoBlue, Natural. Don't use
        anymore: gtk2, nice, nice2, warp3, warp4, yellowmotif.
      Add collate to support locale sensitive comparison using strcoll. Fix an
        obscure bug in mstring::searchAndReplaceAll (unlikely to occur).
      Add support for sorted directory access (locale sensitive).
      Use adir to have browse menus sorted. Make file+folder icons not static
        but local.
      Make PRECONDITION usable in isolation by compile time define PRECON.
      Sort menu entries with collate (strcoll).
      Concentrate nearly all pixmap .xpm loading in one place. More controlled
        loading of pixmaps, would allow to extend it to PNG and SVG. Remove the
        CONFIG_LOOK_* preprocessor symbols as they were not usefully implemented
        and just cluttered. Streamline wmLook and make it print useful info in
        --postpreferences. Make stderr line buffered.
      Typo: fix missing 2 in taskbar2Pixres.
      Remove unused headers.
      Make all configure --enable/--disable options compile again.
      Make some tests compile.
      Document the "env" file.
      Add wpixres.cc to ICEWM_SRCS.
      Document the "focus_mode" file.
      Memory leak fix: don't call newstr on parameters passed to
        YStringArray::append, because that one already does a newstr on the
        received parameter.
      Fix issue #143: remove theme Natural.
      Improve man page documentation about "icewm-session".
      icehelp didn't accept standard IceWM options. If no help file was given
        then use the standard ICEHELPIDX location. This allows to start icehelp
        from the command line by just typing "icehelp".
      Manual page: add "icehelp" to the list of IceWM programs.
      Prevent 3 warnings when compiling with clang++.
      Document focus mode and the taskbar.
      Document the QuickSwitch window and all keyboard shortcuts.
      Fix option parsing for --theme/--config for icewmbg.
      Document window placement, window layers and workspaces.
      Document mouse bindings.
      Document applet details.
      man intro + semitransparency.
      Document icewm signals.
      Enforce 32-bit unsigned comparison of X11 time stamps in updateUserTime.
        This improves availability of focused windows in issue #37.
      Update bug report location to Github.
      Update ChangeLog for 1.4.0 release.
      Update NEWS for 1.4.0 release.
      Update README.md for 1.4.0 release.
      Add missing PACKAGE_BUGREPORT define. Change empty PACKAGE_URL into
        website URL.
      Changes to print_configured to make it compile under CMake.

Release icewm-1.3.10 released 2015-07-02
----------------------------------------

git shortlog -e -n -w80,6,8 1.3.9...1.3.10

Eduard Bloch <blade@debian.org> (68):
      Fix format buffer overflow (Debian bug 765965) and other issues
      Build fix with -Werror and without xrandr support
      Make linking with -lsupc++ effective (w/o stdlibc++)
      German translation update and review
      Basic review of Russian translation (incomplete)
      Language update, merge with some translations from Debian, manual review
        of some typical format string mismatches
      Replaced previous reimplementation of ACOUNT macro
      Unified setting of EXEEXT through Makefile variable only
      Fix the check of fribidi_log2vis' result (the code looks like it was
        intended that way, and clang barfs otherwise)
      this cannot be NULL unless more ugly (and better traceable) mess appears
      Avoid potential use of unitialized value
      Optional use of clang for development, work around unknown pragmas (might
        need a review later)
      Minor improvements after code check with clang++
      Moved yworker.{cc,h} out of the build, apparently not used anymore
      Found the "better traceable mess" expected in a previous commit. Added
        proper checks in callers of YPixmap::replicate(...).
      Stronger control of startup sequence in icewm-session, avoids weird
        effects (like zombie windows) caused by races around icewm vs. icewmtray
        vs. "startup" script execution
      Assign suspend-to-ram action through systemd (if active) which is more
        likely to be available on modern Linux desktops and makes more sense
        than killing running WM with the "Sleep" button
      If Linux and SystemD found, try to use that for default shutdown/reboot
        actions. WLAN interfaces are also more likely to exist nowadays than PPP
        links.
      Little C++14 related fixes
      clang was right, those members are not used and bring some risk of
        programming mistakes
      Experimental mod using signalfd (disabled by default)
      Ignore some IDE metadata
      Fix stupid crash of gnome menu when an invalid folder was specified
      Added alternative XDG menu generator
      Added submenu separation to fdomenu, no sorting yet
      Better recursion control

Jeff Woods <klaatu@fnordco.com> (3):
      Fixed (I think) a double free or corruption bug in acpustatus.cc
      Reverted old flashblock fix because it stops Qt5 apps from creating
        windows, because Qt5 embeds every window.
      Give nice names to the .desktop files, because display managers that use
        the name property show both icewm-session and icewm as just "icewm."
